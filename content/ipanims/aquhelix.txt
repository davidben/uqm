#(AQUHELIX 1)
  ---- REPORT FROM SURFACE ----

CAPTAIN, WE HAVE DISCOVERED SOME
SORT OF ALIEN SHRINE HERE ON THE
SURFACE.

THE BUILDING IS IMMENSELY OLD,
AT LEAST 2000 YEARS. INSCRIBED
AROUND THE PERIMETER OF THE
CYLINDRICAL SHRINE ARE INNUMERABLE
HIEROGLYPHS WHICH DOCUMENT THE
HISTORY OF EACH OF THE NINETEEN
THRADDASH CULTURES.

FROM WHAT WE HAVE SEEN, WE HAVE
LEARNED THAT THE THRADDASH HAVE
RISEN TO STAR-FARING TECHNOLOGY
AT LEAST THREE SEPARATE TIMES,
ONLY TO NUKE THEMSELVES BACK INTO
THE STONE AGE AGAIN AND AGAIN.
THE REAL SURPRISE, CAPTAIN WAS
WHAT WE FOUND INSIDE THE SHRINE!

WE KNEW THE THRADDASH KEPT
SOMETHING DOWN HERE, BUT WE DIDN'T
KNOW WHAT IT WAS UNTIL WE WENT
INSIDE THE SHRINE. IN THE EXACT
MIDDLE OF THE STRUCTURE WAS A TALL
DAIS OF WHITE STONE.  SET ATOP
THIS DAIS WAS AN IMMENSE AQUA
GEMSTONE, SOMEHOW SHAPED INTO A
FLAT TWISTED RIBBON, LIKE A DNA
HELIX.

THE AQUA HELIX EMITTED INCREDIBLE
LIGHT PULSES, ILLUMINATING THE
CAVERNOUS SHRINE LIKE A GIANT
STROBE LIGHT, AT LEAST IT DID...


...UNTIL PRIVATE HENDRYX DECIDED
TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF HE
GRABBED THE ARTIFACT. THE HELIX
IMMEDIATELY CEASED GLOWING, AND
HAS REMAINED QUIESCENT EVER SINCE.

WE WILL BRING THE AQUA HELIX BACK
ABOARD THE SHIP FOR FURTHER
INVESTIGATION.

   ---- END OF REPORT ----
