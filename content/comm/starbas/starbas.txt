 By the way, I thought you should know
#(BEFORE_WE_GO_ON_4) starb003.ogg
 Before we proceed, I wanted you to know
#(BEFORE_WE_GO_ON_5) starb004.ogg
 I have some information I think you should hear
#(BEFORE_WE_GO_ON_6) starb005.ogg
 I've been waiting to inform you of a new situation
#(BEFORE_WE_GO_ON_7) starb006.ogg
 I know you're busy, but I've got some news

#(NORMAL_HELLO_A0) starb007.ogg
Welcome back, Captain 
#(NORMAL_HELLO_A1)
.

#(NORMAL_HELLO_B0) starb008.ogg
Greetings, Captain 
#(NORMAL_HELLO_B1) 
. I am ready to assist you.

#(NORMAL_HELLO_C0) starb009.ogg
It's good to see you again, Captain 
#(NORMAL_HELLO_C1)
.

#(NORMAL_HELLO_D0) starb010.ogg
Ah, Captain

#(NORMAL_HELLO_F0) starb012.ogg
I am at your disposal, Captain 
#(NORMAL_HELLO_F1)
.

#(NORMAL_HELLO_G0) starb013.ogg
Captain 
#(NORMAL_HELLO_G1) 
. I'm glad you made it back in one piece.

#(NORMAL_HELLO_H0) starb014.ogg
I hope the battle fares well, Captain 
#(NORMAL_HELLO_H1)

#(NORMAL_GOODBYE_A0) starb016.ogg
Goodbye, Captain 
#(NORMAL_GOODBYE_A1)
.
#(NORMAL_GOODBYE_B0) starb017.ogg
Bring back lots of minerals, Captain 
#(NORMAL_GOODBYE_B1)
.
#(NORMAL_GOODBYE_C0) starb018.ogg
Return soon, Captain 
#(NORMAL_GOODBYE_C1)
.
#(NORMAL_GOODBYE_D0) starb019.ogg
Farewell Captain 
#(NORMAL_GOODBYE_D1)
.
#(NORMAL_GOODBYE_E0) starb020.ogg
Try to avoid getting gruesomely killed, Captain 
#(NORMAL_GOODBYE_E1)
.
#(NORMAL_GOODBYE_F0) starb021.ogg
We shall await your return, Captain 
#(NORMAL_GOODBYE_F1)
.
#(NORMAL_GOODBYE_G0) starb022.ogg
Blow up an Ur-Quan for me, Captain 
#(NORMAL_GOODBYE_G1)
.
#(NORMAL_GOODBYE_H0) starb023.ogg
Be careful out there, Captain 
#(NORMAL_GOODBYE_H1)
.

#(LIGHT_LOAD_A0) starb024.ogg
The more minerals you bring us, Captain 
#(LIGHT_LOAD_A1) 
, the faster we'll be able to tackle the Ur-Quan.

#(LIGHT_LOAD_B0) starb025.ogg
Light load this time, Captain 
#(LIGHT_LOAD_B1)
.

#(LIGHT_LOAD_C0) starb026.ogg
Another small load, Captain 

#(LIGHT_LOAD_C1) starb027.ogg
. Well, I suppose something is better than nothing.

#(LIGHT_LOAD_D0) starb028.ogg
I don't mean to criticize, Captain 
#(LIGHT_LOAD_D1) 
, but, uh, wouldn't it be more efficient if you could return with larger loads?

#(LIGHT_LOAD_E0) starb029.ogg
Pretty small amounts, Captain 
#(LIGHT_LOAD_E1)
.  Bringing those small amounts of minerals is not cost-effective. Try getting larger loads.

#(LIGHT_LOAD_F0) starb030.ogg
Not too much today, Captain 
#(LIGHT_LOAD_F1) 
. I hope you have better luck next time.

#(LIGHT_LOAD_G0) starb030.ogg
Not too much today, Captain 
#(LIGHT_LOAD_G1)

#(MEDIUM_LOAD_A0) starb031.ogg
Not a bad job, Captain

.

#(MEDIUM_LOAD_B0) starb032.ogg
Good work, Captain

#(MEDIUM_LOAD_C0) starb033.ogg
Thanks, Captain

#(MEDIUM_LOAD_D0) starb034.ogg
Keep it coming, Captain

#(MEDIUM_LOAD_E0) starb035.ogg
Pretty fair load, Captain 
#(MEDIUM_LOAD_E1)
. Can you do better next time?

#(MEDIUM_LOAD_F0) starb036.ogg
Don't stop now, Captain 
#(MEDIUM_LOAD_F1) 
. We can use every bit you bring us.

#(MEDIUM_LOAD_G0) starb037.ogg
A fair haul, Captain 
#(MEDIUM_LOAD_G1) 
. Maybe you should consider adding a storage bay so you can gather larger loads.

#(HEAVY_LOAD_A0) starb038.ogg
Excellent work, Captain 
#(HEAVY_LOAD_A1)
!

#(HEAVY_LOAD_B0) starb039.ogg
This will really help, Captain 
#(HEAVY_LOAD_B1)
.

#(HEAVY_LOAD_C0) starb040.ogg
A fine job, Captain 
#(HEAVY_LOAD_C1)
!

#(HEAVY_LOAD_D0) starb041.ogg
Wow, 
#(HEAVY_LOAD_D1)
, you really hit the mother lode this time!

#(HEAVY_LOAD_E0) starb042.ogg
If you can keep this up, 
#(HEAVY_LOAD_E1) 
, we'll turn that flagship of yours into a genuine Dreadnought-Killer.

#(HEAVY_LOAD_F0) starb043.ogg
Captain 
#(HEAVY_LOAD_F1) 
, you are to be commended. Keep up the good work!

#(HEAVY_LOAD_G0) starb044.ogg
More fuel for the fire, eh, Captain 
#(HEAVY_LOAD_G1) 
?  That last load should keep it blazing!

#(STARBASE_IS_READY_A) starb045.ogg
I have good news to report, Captain.
We have successfully integrated the Precursor technology from your ship into our fabricator system
and as you can see, we have already begun minor repairs on 

#(STARBASE_IS_READY_B)
, patching up some of the micro-meteorite holes.
We noticed that your ship does not have an emergency warp escape unit
So our engineers rigged up some for you and each of your escorts.
Now you should be able to escape from a bad situation
with the touch of a button.  But there is a cost, however
The unit gulps up five fuel units each time your Precursor ship uses it.
Also, we now have a limited capacity to make modifications to your ship
to refine starship fuel, to build additional combat ships
and to train new members of your crew for the 

#(STARBASE_IS_READY_C)
 and any ships you acquire for your fleet.
Captain, I know you're eager to get to work, so I'll be brief.
If you have any questions -- how this Starbase works, what resources we need
or just some background information on the galaxy -- don't hesitate to ask.

#(WHAT_KIND_OF_INFO) starb046.ogg
Certainly, Captain. What do you need to know?

#(WHICH_FUNCTION) starb047.ogg
We can modify your Precursor ship, build additional combat vessels
and supply you with fuel and crew.

#(WHICH_HISTORY) starb048.ogg
What aspect of history, Captain?

#(WHICH_MISSION) starb049.ogg
Can you be more specific?

#(OK_NO_NEED_INFO) starb050.ogg
Fine. Is there anything else you need?

#(ABOUT_FUEL) starb051.ogg
This base is designed to service Hierarchy ships.
Fortunately, your flagship uses the same stabilized antimatter technology as Hierarchy vessels
and we'll be able to synthesize what you need.
However, due to the size of your ship, we'll have to produce vast quantities of fuel
which will be a substantial drain on our resources.

#(ABOUT_MODULES) starb052.ogg
Our engineers and Precursor specialists agree with the scientists from your world
that your starship was designed to be a `workhorse' vehicle
which can be easily reconfigured for different missions
by adding or swapping self-contained equipment packs which we call `modules'.
The modules we can build right now are:
Thruster units which make your ship move faster
Attitude Jets which allow you to rotate the ship more quickly
Crew Pods which provide life-support facilities for up to 50 additional crew members
Storage Bays which increase your ship's cargo capacity for mineral resources
Fuel Tanks which hold an additional 50 units of fuel
Dynamos which feed energy into your combat energy batteries, improving your weapons' rate of fire.
And last but not least
Ion-Bolt Guns - combat weaponry, the exact function of which depends on its location aboard the ship
when put in the first, or front module slot, it fires a single shot forward
when put in the second slot, it fires two shots spread to the left and right of center
when put in the third slot, it fires two shots directly left and right
and when put in the last or rear slot, it fires a single shot straight backwards.

#(ABOUT_CREW0) starb053.ogg
We have almost 2000 highly-motivated, skilled professionals aboard this starbase
and every single one of them wants a berth aboard 
#(ABOUT_CREW1)
. However, each hand we lose to your ship means less manpower here at the starbase
and this is reflected in the Crew RU cost.
As long as you don't lose too many crew members to combat or planet exploration
the RU cost will remain static; but we have only so many warm bodies on this starbase
and if your needs for crew grow beyond a certain point
the cost could increase dramatically.

#(ABOUT_SHIPS) starb054.ogg
Our shipyard facilities are sophisticated and fully automated,
permitting a handful of starbase personnel to do the same job
as five-hundred, vac-suited construction workers.
However, the only designs that we had in our computers were incomplete, Hierarchy ship designs.
Things looked grim until one of the officers came forward with an amazing story.
Even though the Ur-Quan destroyed every Earthling Cruiser in the fleet nearly 20 years ago
one of my maintenance engineers was a starship production assistant at the Detroit shipyards.
When Earth was conquered, she was ordered to destroy all ship-construction databases;
but she secretly made copies of the blueprint disks, and then kept them with her ever since.
These disks contain all the data we need to build as many Earthling Cruisers as you want
provided you, Captain, can supply the large amounts of mineral resources required to build those vessels.
In theory, Captain, we could build alien starships here if we had designs for them; however,
it's a well known fact that alien vessels just can't be flown in combat
without native starship captains at the helm.

#(ABOUT_RU) starb055.ogg
As you know, Captain, we've committed the entire output of this station
to building your flagship and your battle fleet into the strongest force possible.
However, our resources are very limited, and we feel YOU must decide
how we are to spend our effort and materials.
To aid you in making these decisions, we have implemented a resource allocation scheme.
We provide you with a numerical assessment of the station's resources
and ascribe a cost to each task we can perform and each device we can build.
It's up to you to decide how you are going to `spend' your resource units or `RU' as we call them.
To acquire more RU, you must bring resources back to the starbase.
These resources can be either in the form of mineral ores gathered from planet surfaces
or already-refined metals and other valuable materials from the wreckage of enemy starships.

#(ABOUT_MINERALS) starb056.ogg
The most straightforward way you can accumulate Resource Units
is to bring mineral ores back to this starbase.
There are probably enough resources in just the nearby dozen stars
to build your ship into a powerful battleship, or
to create a strong task force of combat vessels.
I would also recommend that you build several additional Storage Bays.
When gathering minerals, focus on `cleaning-out' one star system at a time.
This way, you minimize the cost of travel through HyperSpace.

#(ABOUT_LIFE) starb057.ogg
While I respect your search for abstract knowledge
frankly, Captain, in our present circumstances I see little use for such data here.
Perhaps you can make use of biological information elsewhere.

#(OK_ENOUGH_STARBASE) starb058.ogg
What else can I tell you?

#(OK_ENOUGH_MISSION) starb059.ogg
What else can I tell you?

#(GET_MINERALS) starb060.ogg
If you have the patience, I would recommend you spend several months
or even a year gathering mineral resources.
You can find such minerals on almost any planet surface,
but the quality and density will vary depending on the type of planet you're on.
Base metals are probably the most common materials you'll find, but they aren't particularly valuable.
You can find rarer precious and radioactive elements on metal-rich worlds such as Mercury.
An old miner once told me that you could tell the relative quality of a planet's minerals
based on the planet's color as seen from space.
To remember the color sequence from good to bad
The miner had a mnemonic which went something like
`Very Young Orangutans Could Grow Bananas, Perhaps Rather Well'.
It is also the case that mineral yields will be better at hotter stars.
Temperature is related to the size and color of a star
Red stars are the coolest, then orange, yellow, green, blue
And the hottest stars are white.

#(ABOUT_ALIENS) starb061.ogg
That all depends on whom you meet, doesn't it, Captain?
Well, in all seriousness, if you encounter the Ilwrath, VUX, Androsynth, or other Hierarchy battle thralls
I wouldn't hold out much hope for a peaceful encounter.
So if you feel you have the advantage, attack!
The resources you will scavenge from the enemies' wreckage are well worth the effort.
If you can find Alliance races who are in a position to help us
then you MUST convince them to join with us!
Their assistance may be crucial to our success.

#(MUST_DEFEAT) starb062.ogg
Captain, I wish I had an easy answer, but I don't.
The only way I can see of liberating Earth, as well as the Alliance allies
...is to destroy the Ur-Quan and their armada of battle thralls entirely.

#(DEFEAT_LIKE_SO) starb063.ogg
To defeat our enemies, we will need awesome strength, both in your flagship and the fleet
as well as the assistance of powerful new allies.
Though combat will be unavoidable, and sometimes necessary to achieve our goals
I am certain your wits will be at least as important as your weapons.
You will need to explore this region of space, gathering resources and information wherever you go.

#(FIND_URQUAN) starb064.ogg
I don't know, Captain,
but I suspect their battle thralls know more than we do;
so I suggest you try to gather information from them, perhaps by force.

#(FIGHT_URQUAN) starb065.ogg
At first, your ship will be far too vulnerable to permit frontal assaults on the Ur-Quan.
Even when your ship is at full power, we are faced with the reality
that the Hierarchy has THOUSANDS of ships
You cannot win the fight alone, Captain. You need allies.
Also, towards the end of the War, when the Hierarchy broke through the coreward front,
we heard rumors that the Ur-Quan had unleashed some kind of super-weapon
which was unstoppable by normal means.
You need to find out if that rumor was true, Captain
because if the Ur-Quan do have such a weapon, we'll have to find some way to stop it
or all our efforts are for naught.

#(ALLY_LIKE_SO) starb066.ogg
If you encounter an unknown alien race, proceed carefully and diplomatically --
-- we need all the friends we can get, and we certainly can't afford any more enemies. 
Remember, Captain, with your Precursor starship, you hold awesome power
but there will be situations when dealing with an alien race
where a `carrot' will serve better than a `stick'.
But first you must determine what `carrot' the alien wants.

#(STRONG_LIKE_SO) starb067.ogg
You need to accumulate enough resources so that we can build up your flagship
and assemble a strong fleet. I'd also recommend
that you acquire blueprints for other, more powerful ships than our trusty Cruiser.
I suspect that aliens will not give you such `prints unless you form an alliance with them.

#(OK_ENOUGH_DEFEAT) starb068.ogg
What else can we discuss?

#(WHICH_ALIEN) starb069.ogg
Which group of aliens?

#(WHICH_WAR) starb070.ogg
What about the War?

#(WHICH_ANCIENT) starb071.ogg
We have some data on this subject.  What do you want to know about?

#(OK_ENOUGH_HISTORY) starb072.ogg
Sure. Anything else?

#(WHICH_ALLIANCE) starb073.ogg
Okay, which race?

#(WHICH_HIERARCHY) starb074.ogg
Which species?

#(ABOUT_OTHER) starb075.ogg
None that we had made formal contact with.
The Chenjesu implied that they had met 2 other starfaring species
one near the Giclas constellation, and the other directly coreward from Procyon.
The Ariloulaleelay once mentioned having `some fun' with an alien race in Draconis
but like so much else with the Arilou, they never revealed the whole story.
I am sure there are hundreds more alien races in our galaxy,
but beyond what I've told you, your guess is as good as mine.

#(OK_ENOUGH_ALIENS) starb076.ogg
Would you like information on any other aspect of history?

#(ABOUT_SHOFIXTI) starb077.ogg
The Shofixti are a race of intelligent marsupials who had been `civilized' for only a few decades when the War began.
They were discovered in the Delta Gorno star system by the Yehat
who adopted and then `uplifted' the Shofixti, giving them advanced technology and cultural definition.
Shofixti are noble and fearless Warriors, Captain. In addition, their incredible fecundity and rapid maturation rate
kept Alliance ranks solid even at the worst part of the War.
You know, I once flew as a observer aboard one of their ships
on routine patrol, we never saw the enemy
but I could never stop thinking about the `Glory Device' it had strapped to the bottom of its hull.

#(ABOUT_YEHAT) starb078.ogg
The Yehat are a race of ancient warrior clans that have been traveling the stars for many centuries.
The clans are highly competitive and sometimes even wage war on each other;
but the clans are all loyal to the Queen and her royal family, known as the Veep-Zeeps.
The Veep-Zeeps have been in power for over 2,000 years, and it is said that during their rule
the Yehat never lost a battle.

#(ABOUT_ARILOU) starb079.ogg
I'd like to think I'm not a bigoted person, Captain, especially when it comes to allies
but there is just something about those Arilou that gives me the creeps.
One thing I'll say for them, though
they possess some technique for moving REALLY fast through HyperSpace.
They never let us know what it was, but it sure beats the pants off our fastest ships.

#(ABOUT_CHENJESU) starb080.ogg
The Chenjesu were leaders of the Alliance, even though they refused to accept formally the title.
I don't know if their silicon-based biology is just plain superior to our old carbon models
or if their fantastic intellects were the product of an ancient, peaceful culture.
Whatever the reason, I'd rather be taking orders from a Chenjesu than any other lifeform, absolutely.
One of the more amazing things about them was that they never used HyperWave communicators.
They could send messages naturally
And their natural HyperWave receptors were much more sensitive than even our best units.

#(ABOUT_MMRNMHRM) starb081.ogg
We didn't really get much of a chance to learn about those mechanical beings,
but I'll tell you what I know.
They are the product of a distant, unknown culture
who sent a giant Factory-Ark into our region of space many centuries ago.
The Mother-Ark (that's what the Earth press called it) churned out millions of robots and finally broke down.
I don't know why the Mmrnmhrm didn't repair the Mother-Ark, maybe they can't.
My personal guess as to why they were sent here is that they're on the leading edge of a colonization project
and once the Mmrnmhrm have tamed enough new worlds, the genuine colonists -- whoever they are
will arrive and claim their due.

#(ABOUT_SYREEN) starb082.ogg
Most raw recruits saw the Syreen as nothing more than warm, breathing pin-ups.
Warm they are, and yes, they do breathe most magnificently
but Captain, they are far more than simple joy units.
Their history shows that the Syreen established and maintained a peaceful culture
from their Bronze Age through their discovery of starflight.
Before their planet was destroyed in a horrible cataclysm, their world was an Eden.

#(OK_ENOUGH_ALLIANCE) starb083.ogg
What other group of aliens are you interested in?

#(ABOUT_URQUAN) starb084.ogg
Our enemy is cunning, relentless and possesses technology superior to all but, perhaps
that found aboard your starship.
The Ur-Quan are born, live and die for one purpose only:
the subjugation of all other intelligent life in the galaxy.
Why? I don't know.
They'd probably have an easier time just destroying intelligence
but they are very careful not to use more force than is necessary to achieve their victim's submission.
I'd sure like to know what made those wormy bastards as twisted as they are
and I'd like to know why they keep on the move, never stopping longer than it takes
to enslave whomever they find.

#(ABOUT_MYCON) starb085.ogg
The Mycons are hard to get a handle on.
In fact, I'm not sure any human has ever had a real conversation with a Mycon.
What we know of them we have learned from their corpses, which, I may add
have a nasty habit of coming back to life when thawed out from a decompression quick-freeze.
Mycon ships seem to expend a significant amount of energy on life support.
This is probably because the Mycon only thrive in temperatures close to the melting point of lead.
As far as we know, the Mycon are the only race to actively seek out the Ur-Quan
in order to become combat slaves.

#(ABOUT_SPATHI) starb086.ogg
Imagine facing a cowardly, mobile clam armed with a howitzer
and you've got good idea of what it's like dealing with a Spathi.
Although they tend to avoid battles as much as their masters will allow
Once in battle, a Spathi Eluder is one tough cookie.
I once heard a rumor, though I don't like to believe in it myself,
that a rogue band of courageous Spathi broke away from the main starfleet,
painted their ships black with bright red stripes
and formed the `Black Spathi Squadron', dedicated to performing brave and hostile deeds.
Like I said, I'd have to see it to believe it.

#(ABOUT_UMGAH) starb087.ogg
It's unfortunate that the Umgah fell to the Ur-Quan so early in the War
because I suspect we would have gotten along well with those big blob creatures;
at the very least it would have been entertaining.
We know them a bit better than most races, because they were eager to talk with our ships
before, after, and during battle.
The Arilou intimated that they had a relationship with the Umgah before the Ur-Quan arrived
but I don't know any details.

#(ABOUT_ANDROSYNTH) starb088.ogg
When I was flying combat missions along the Coreward Front
there was nothing we feared more than the Androsynth Hit-And-Run Squadron.
Their Blazer ships were more than a match for our Cruisers
so we stayed clear of Eta Vulpeculae, their home star.
In addition, I think each of us aboard the ship knew deep down in our hearts
that the Androsynth had a damn good reason for hating us.
Our grandparents had kept them as slaves for nearly 50 years.

#(ABOUT_VUX) starb089.ogg
The starship Far Voyager, under the command of Captain Jeffry L. Rand, encountered the VUX near Beta Mira.
Although the details are hazy, it is generally accepted that Rand offended the VUX starship Commander
with an inadvertent insult.

#(ABOUT_ILWRATH) starb090.ogg
I still have nightmares about those spiders
taking me prisoner -- using me as one of their sick sacrifices to Dogar and Kazon
their twin gods of destruction and torment.
Those guys were almost as scary as the Androsynth to those of us in deep-space patrol.
Their Avenger ships could appear out of nowhere and melt a Cruiser down to slag in seconds.
Luckily for us, the bulk of the Ilwrath fleet was thrown against the Chenjesu and the Mmrnmhrm.

#(OK_ENOUGH_HIERARCHY) starb091.ogg
What other group of aliens are you interested in?

#(ABOUT_PRECURSORS) starb092.ogg
Hell, you probably know more about them than I do, but here goes... about 200,000 years ago
when our great-to-the-nth-grandparents were just starting to play with stone knives and bearskins
a starfaring species suddenly appeared on the galactic scene and spread like wildfire.
We've found evidence of their presence just about everywhere
from an orbital platform in Alpha Centauri, to a stack of DataPlates in a cave on Pluto
to some nameless widget found in a voodoo shop in New Orleans.
Though we've never found a Precursor body, or even a picture of one
we can conjecture what they looked like by examining the scale and layout of their equipment.
Such an analysis indicates they were giants, say 5 to 8 meters tall, and twice as wide.
I don't know if they looked more like a brontosaur or an elephant
Anyway, about three thousand years after the Precursors made their dramatic appearance
they vanished, poof! As far as we can tell, it took less than a decade to happen.

#(ABOUT_OLD_RACES) starb093.ogg
You mean besides the Precursors? Well, the only information we have is second-hand
based on some research by a Chenjesu historian that I read at the Academy.
Tzzz-Tzer-Tzak, the historian, found some evidence that there was a group of alien races
who formed an interstellar empire not too far from here about 22,000 years ago.
The only species in this empire actually lived in our region of space
was a race of rocklike creatures who lived in the Vulpeculae constellation.
The presence of the hostile Androsynth in that part of space
severely limited Tzzz-Tzer-Tzak's research.
He never even found out the race's name.

#(ABOUT_ALIENS_ON_EARTH) starb094.ogg
Yes, there is.
Aside from the Precursor relics we have found on Earth --
-- often in museums, mislabeled as `modern art' --
-- we have discovered disturbing evidence of much more recent visitations.
Perhaps you are already aware that during the mid-to-late 20th century
there were uncountable UFO sightings, as well as dozens of reported `encounters' with alien life forms.
Although we can discount many of the reports as wishful fabrication or traumatic-translation
the military authorities of that time kept a secret record of the `incidents' which were legitimate.
In each such case, the aliens are almost identical in appearance.
They have white skin and minimal facial features, except for huge, almond-shaped eyes
which are often described as `glowing' or `luminescent'.
This description fits, almost perfectly, the Ariloulaleelay.
In most of the legitimate encounters
the people involved described being physically examined or modified by the aliens.
In come cases, unusual pregnancies occurred, and in almost every instance, there were repeat visitations
as though the Ariloulaleelay were doing `check-ups' on their subjects.
We never got the chance to confront the Ariloulaleelay about what they did to us and why.
I wonder if we ever will?

#(OK_ENOUGH_ANCIENT) starb095.ogg
Would you like information on any other aspect of history?

#(URQUAN_STARTED_WAR) starb096.ogg
Earth got involved late in the game, in 2112, when the Chenjesu arrived in our solar system for the first time
so let's back up a few years to 2098
when the Chenjesu's super-sensitive receivers detected a strange signal from the Ophiuchi constellation.
Though even the Chenjesu didn't know it, it was the first sign of the Ur-Quan's arrival.
The Ur-Quan, having detected the presence of many sentient species, were beaming out an exulting hunting cry.
The first direct evidence of the Ur-Quan's intent
was the sudden conquest of the Umgah, a solitary, though not unfriendly, species in the Orionis constellation.
The Chenjesu, distraught by the invasion, were further angered when the Ur-Quan
turned their fleets on the hostile but weak Ilwrath race.
A hastily assembled defense force of Mmrnmhrm and Chenjesu vessels turned the Ur-Quan fleet aside
but the invader moved into Spathi space, rapidly subjugating that race.
With each new conquest, the Ur-Quan fleet grew larger as it added slave vessels to its ranks.
Earth joined the Chenjesu to form the Alliance of Free Stars at about the same time as
the Androsynth stars fell to the Ur-Quan armada.
Before the ink was dry on our agreement with the Chenjesu in 2116
a new race appeared in orbit around the moon and asked for admittance to the Alliance
it was the Ariloulaleelay.
The timing seemed unusual and the Arilou were definitely weird, looking like Saucer Men from Mars
but we were too busy cranking up our moth-balled heavy industry
that we didn't really pay it much attention at the time.

#(WAR_WAS_LIKE_SO) starb097.ogg
At the start of the war, here on Earth we were working like crazy
churning out hundreds of heavy Cruisers and smaller support vehicles.
The Ur-Quan were busy too.  Unbeknownst to us, they had moved down toward the Luyten star group
and were attacking the VUX, who only the Yehat knew existed.
Our botched first contact with the VUX took place in 2119, and it was the biggest single mistake we made during the War.
After defeating the VUX, the Ur-Quan fleets ran smack into the combined might of the Yehat and Shofixti
supported by the first wave of our cruisers.
Again the Ur-Quan turned away from the hard spot to attack the weak, though we just thought they were running away.
In fact, the Ur-Quan had found another independent alien race, the Mycon, in the Brahe constellation.
The Mycon's voluntary submission to the Ur-Quan
brought the return of the Ur-Quan fleets, now swollen with a hundred devastating Mycon Podships.
The last entrants to the conflict were the Syreen, a race of space gypsies
who had escaped the Hierarchy by moving their vast fleet of slow-moving habitats into human space.
With the sides set, the last Ur-Quan offensive began.

#(LOST_WAR_BECAUSE) starb098.ogg
The Ur-Quan came roaring through VUX space, and tried to push past the Indi and Mira star systems.
Their onslaught was barely repulsed and our counter-attack made hardly a dent in the Hierarchy forces
but we held the line -- The Coreward front remained intact.
Over the following ten years, there were many great battles between the combined Alliance starfleet
and the Ur-Quan and their Hierarchy of Battle Thralls.
Then, in 2134, a dramatic shift in the balance of power took place --
-- this must have been about the time the science research mission was sent to the planet at Vela --
-- our fleets were pushed back from the Indi-Mira line to beyond Raynet.
Holding Rigel cost grievously in Chenjesu forces and the Ur-Quan, recognizing this weakness
shifted to focus the brunt of their forces on Procyon.
That was the last we heard from the Chenjesu and the Mmrnmhrm.
A few weeks later, waves of ships hit us from all directions.
When Ceres Station, our outpost in the Asteroid belt, fell to the Hierarchy, we knew we were beaten
but we fought on anyway.
Three days later the Ur-Quan vaporized our last remaining laser-forts on the moon
and the Dreadnoughts took up geo-synchronous position above Rome
Moscow, Beijing, Tokyo, London, Buenos Aires, and Washington.
We'd lost the War and we knew it, but the Ur-Quan decided to make it real clear --
-- and that's why if you check any of our most recent maps, you won't find Buenos Aires.

#(AFTER_WAR) starb099.ogg
After the UN submitted their formal surrender
we were given a week to decide the nature of our servitude.
The Ur-Quan demanded that the decision be made through popular vote.
When all the votes were tallied, Earth had chosen not to fight for the Ur-Quan
we had become a fallow slave world.
We were given a month to withdraw all of our people and equipment to Earth.
Anyone or anything we left off-planet would be destroyed after the shield went up.
Then the Ur-Quan broadcast an odd message
all objects of human construction more than 500 years old were `to be abandoned'.
We didn't know what the Ur-Quan meant until they moved their Dreadnoughts to new orbital positions
and opened fire on the surface with their fusion weapons.
In seconds, large sections of London, Paris, and other European cities were incinerated.
At first we thought they were going to annihilate us after all
and we noticed that they were also striking such targets as the Giza Pyramids
the Parthenon in Athens, and Stonehenge. Curiously, The United States was almost untouched.
The flaming rain lasted 40 hellish hours.
It took days after we crawled from our smoldering shelters to realize what the Ur-Quan had done.
Our new masters had targeted every building, monument or other manmade construction older than 500 years
and destroyed it.
In those two days, we lost most of the history of Mankind.
In some cases, the Ur-Quan destroyed places
we did not even suspect were significant.
From their positions in orbit, the Dreadnoughts blew away a kilometer of land in central Iraq
vaporized several targets in the Amazon rain forest
punched a big hole through the Antarctic icecap to destroy something deep under the surface
and melted a broad swath of the ocean floor in the south-eastern Atlantic.
Then, just a couple of days later, the shield went up
and our contact with the outside world stopped.
The next time I saw the stars was 8 years ago,
when I was transferred up here to be the new commander of this starbase.

#(OK_ENOUGH_WAR) starb100.ogg
Would you like any information on any other aspect of history?

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_TAIL) starb101.ogg
That's all for now, Captain.

#(BETWEEN_BULLETINS) starb102.ogg
also

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_1) starb103.ogg
Captain, a delegation of Spathi has just arrived here under orders from their High Council
to form an alliance and assist you against the Hierarchy!
They have provided fabricator blueprint data for their `Eluder' spacecraft
and promise a steady supply of captains for as many ships as we build.
Excellent work, Captain!

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_2) starb104.ogg
It would appear that your diplomatic efforts have struck gold, Captain.
We have been contacted by a race called the Zoq-Fot-Pik,
who wish to fulfill their part of `the Unification' --
-- something you have arranged with them, I gather.
They have sent us specifications for their Stinger-class attack vessels
as well as a large number of Zoq-Fot-Pik commanding officers.
You're doing a fine job, Captain.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_3) starb105.ogg
A race of plant creatures called the Supox have arrived in your absence, Captain.
They offered use of their ship designs and will supply you as many starship captains as we require.
I, of course, accepted their offer immediately.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_4) starb106.ogg
A small contingent of Utwig has visited.
After spending a few days setting up our fabricators to build their Jugger starships
and providing us with a few capable commanders, they departed.
Captain, if you continue to build such strong alliances
we will surely win our battle against the Ur-Quan!

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_5) starb107.ogg
We have been invaded by an alien race calling themselves the `Orz', though so far the invasion is a friendly one.
The fishlike creatures have been stomping around the base in their robotic walking exoskeletons
which look like combat vac-suits, if you ask me.
Based on the summary reports I've seen on their `Nemesis' ship design, I have but a single comment:
I like it!
I'd say we have quite a nasty little surprise in store for the Ur-Quan the next time you tangle with them.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_6) starb108.ogg
Good news, Captain!
With no announcement, a small fleet of Ariloulaleelay popped into space adjacent to our starbase
scaring the hell out of the Deep-Radar operator
but right now I could kiss every one of those pale little weirdoes
because they gave us three Skiff vessels!

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_7) starb109.ogg
We are receiving a priority distress call from the Zoq-Fot Homeworld at Alpha Tucanae.
The signal was urgent but extremely weak. The only portions of the transmission that we can be sure of are:
`HELP!'
`BLACK DESTROYER!'
`PLANET UNDER ATTACK!'
`HELP!'
`WORSE THAN ZEBRANKY!' (whatever that means)
and finally
`HELP!'

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_8) starb110.ogg
A previously unknown alien race has recently made contact with our base.
They call themselves the Melnorme, and they are anxious to initiate trading relations with us.
If we are interested, they suggest making a rendezvous at Alpha Centauri.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_9) starb111.ogg
The Melnorme have returned, wondering when you want to meet them.
They seemed friendly but are unwilling to deal with us,
claiming that we have no data they consider valuable.
They said to make contact with them in any supergiant star system.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_10) starb112.ogg
Our deep-space monitoring team has detected faint alien signals coming from
Uranus
or somewhere in that general direction.
The emanations are definitely being generated from within the solar system
and could represent the presence of a Hierarchy spy.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_11) starb113.ogg
We have a major situation Captain!
As of a few days ago, all Spathi starship captains have vanished from our starbase.
We don't know how or why, but until we receive replacements from Spathiwa
you will be unable to commission any additional Spathi Eluder vessels for your fleet.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_12) starb114.ogg
We are being bathed in broad-beam HyperWave transmission from the direction of the Rigel star system.
Due to the broadcast's wide dispersion, we cannot discern its content.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_13) starb115.ogg
We have made a formal alliance with the Chmmr.
Their ships can now be built in our shipyards.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_14) starb116.ogg
The Shofixti have returned!
Their ships can now be built in our shipyards.
With their vast numbers swelling our ranks
we won't have to worry about running out of able-bodied crew
and I'm sure their volunteers will reduce the cost for new crew.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_15) starb117.ogg
We have detected a minute but measurable disturbance in the InterSpace fabric
at approximate TrueSpace coordinate 100:50.
Our scientists speculate that this disturbance may be caused by many thousands of HyperWarp penetrations
all in phase -- as though a huge fleet of ships were on the move.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_16) starb118.ogg
In the log of your voyage from Unzervalt, I read that you encountered a tumbling,
red probe that attacked the Tobermoon, killing Captain Burton.
Over the past few months we have monitored an increasing number of these probes entering the system,
and I'm afraid their population seems to be growing geometrically.
If this continues, in a year space will be crawling with these things!
I recommend you treat this as a serious problem now, before it becomes a disaster.
Discover who is producing these probes and stop them from creating any more.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_18) starb119.ogg
This seems strange to me, and I considered not bringing it up
but not long ago, six of my people fell unconscious simultaneously for no apparent reason.
When they awoke hours later, they reported being overwhelmed by a feeling
of something VERY wrong that had taken place.
The Med Techs couldn't find anything wrong with these crew members, but they discovered one correlation.
All six of them have exceptionally high esper ratings.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_19) starb120.ogg
In the two weeks that have passed since the Chmmr began to work on your vessel
they attached the Utwig bomb to your ship, and have also put in place
their own crystalline amplification devices to boost dramatically the power of the weapon.
This work is now complete, and your flagship is ready for what ever final modifications you desire.
The Chmmr technicians wanted me to explain to you that the bomb and its crystal power boosters
are fragile and cannot be moved from their positions at the back of your vehicle.
Now I have some bad news, and some good news.
The Chmmr had to remove all your main modules, weapons, crew pods, and the whole lot
including your emergency warp escape unit
so pick your engagements carefully, Captain.
In addition, their equipment now fills the rear ten slots leaving you only six for your own modules.
But here's the good news
The Chmmr have provided us with an unbelievable wealth of minerals and other resources.
We no longer have limits on what we can build for your flagship, or your fleet.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_22) starb121.ogg
I have some somber news.
For weeks now we have been scanning space in the direction of the Tucanae stars
hoping to hear some word from our Zoq-Fot-Pik allies,
with no success. We must assume that something grave has happened to them.
We did receive an alien broadcast however -- it rang through space like an electronic howl.
I think the best way to describe it would be...
`exultant'.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_27) starb122.ogg
Captain, I have an unpleasant topic to discuss with you, but this needs to be resolved right away.
There is some kind of wild rumor blowing around the starbase
that you have sold your own crew to the Druuge as slaves.
Pretty crazy, eh?
Look Captain, I know you would never do anything like that, and I'm sorry I even had to mention this
but now I can assure everyone that this is just one of those damn fool lies that gets spread during wartime.
Thank you for your patience, Captain.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_28) starb123.ogg
I have just received incontrovertible evidence
that you HAVE been selling members of your own crew to the Druuge.
Captain, how could you!? Don't you know what the Druuge will use those men and women for?
Cannon-fodder, plain and simple. They are probably already dead, thanks to you.
It's a crime, Captain, a heinous crime -- even during wartime.
You must assure me that you will NEVER do this again!
Even with that assurance, great damage has been done.
With the word out on what you have done, it's going to be pretty damn hard to recruit volunteers
for your next trip.
I expect the RU cost for crew will sky-rocket.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_29) starb124.ogg
Well Captain, we have another problem.
Your efforts on our behalf have been amazing, I truly believe we may win this struggle
but these achievements have not been gained without a price.
Over a thousand of my people have gone away with you on your ship
and not returned.
A THOUSAND, Captain!
Crew are quickly becoming a valuable commodity
and I expect their RU cost will reflect this.

#(STARBASE_BULLETIN_30) starb125.ogg
I can't believe what I've just heard!
Captain, you're a heinous slave-trader!
Your exchanges with the Druuge have become a horror story throughout the entire starbase.
If anyone here is stupid enough to join your crew, I expect the RU cost will be sky high.
If you weren't our only hope for freedom, Captain, I'd kill you where you stand.
As it is, expect me to bring charges against you when this is all over.

#(DEVICE_HEAD) starb126.ogg
The analysis reads as follows:

#(BETWEEN_DEVICES) starb127.ogg
The next entry in the analysis is:

#(DEVICE_TAIL) starb128.ogg
That's the end of our scientists' report.

#(ABOUT_PORTAL) starb129.ogg
SUBJECT: QuasiSpace Portal Spawner.
DATA: Device is a hybrid of different alien technologies, including Arilou and Ur-Quan elements.
Our tests show that this device temporarily creates a weakness in the fabric between HyperSpace
and a different, unidentified dimension. The energy cost for this process is extreme
and since the unit's power supply is self-contained, we cannot estimate how long it will remain functional.
SUMMARY: Use of this device will permit a starship to make transit to a different dimension.
The hazards and benefits of this process are impossible to gauge without field study.

#(ABOUT_TALKPET) starb130.ogg
SUBJECT: Talking Pet Lifeform.
DATA: This creature is physiologically identical to the so-called Ur-Quan `Talking Pet', with one notable exception:
It is highly intelligent, and evidences strong psychic capabilities.
Initial AIQR tests rated it well above human super-genius
though immediately after we made this shocking assessment
its scores dropped to the normal-sub-normal range.
Interviews with the subject have shown it to be cooperative
though a class-IV pan-species psychological profile places the creature far into the `Furtive-Hateful' domain.
There were also some disturbing incidents where
we talked about roses, daisies, and other pretty flowers!
SUMMARY: Everything's okay! Nothing to worry about with this cuddly little guy.
Not one thing!

#(ABOUT_BOMB) starb131.ogg
SUBJECT: Utwig Bomb Device.
DATA: Analysis has yielded little information about this device
largely because of our technicians' unwillingness to open it, or even remove the bomb from your ship.
That aside, here's what we know so far:
The device is correctly defined as a Bomb... one of enormous destructive potential
but it is not of Utwig origin -- nothing about it relates to the technology we see in the Jugger ship.
We believe it to be of late Precursor origin
though it somewhat resembles certain Chenjesu technology.
Its original function? -- Probably a planeteering tool for dispersing unwanted moons.
SUMMARY: Unless there is a strong reason to do otherwise
DO NOT ACTIVATE THIS DEVICE! LEAVE IT ALONE!
Any experimentation should be conducted AT LEAST 12 AU from this starbase
and preferably a bit further.

#(ABOUT_SUN) starb132.ogg
SUBJECT: Sun Device.
DATA: The unit contains a power generator whose output magnitude is simply mind-croggling.
When activated, the device radiates energy equivalent to less than 1/100 of 1% of our sun
however, when placed close to a planet, perhaps in orbit, its output would rival Sol's.
SUMMARY: Another Precursor tool, the energy output of which can replace or augment a sun's radiance.

#(ABOUT_MAIDENS) starb133.ogg
SUBJECT: Shofixti Maidens.
DATA: Subjects appear to be 16 Shofixti females, all in young adulthood.
Subjects appear to be in good condition, with little or no freezer burn or other degeneration.
Hibernation maintenance units are functioning normally, and resuscitation equipment is easily activated.
SUMMARY: We can wake them, but why? What shall we tell them? That they are an extinct species?
Until such a time as we feel we can induce artificial parthenogenesis
or otherwise give the Shofixti sexual viability, our recommendation is to keep them as they are
asleep.

#(ABOUT_SPHERE) starb134.ogg
SUBJECT: Rosy Sphere Device.
DATA: The specimen is 5 centimeters in diameter, perfectly smooth
and composed of a blood-red translucent substance.
Tests show that it has atypical ferro-magnetic properties, but is utterly non-conductive.
SUMMARY: Probably a Precursor tool -- function unknown.

#(ABOUT_HELIX) starb135.ogg
SUBJECT: Aqua Helix Device.
DATA: This device is composed of a light blue, super-hard substance which rates Mohs-13.
The object is composed of a flat ribbon of homogenous material approximately 1 meter in length
and it is twisted in a perfect helix.
Focused ion and nucleo-magnetic scans reveal little about its interior.
SUMMARY: Unknown design. Unknown origin. Unknown function.

#(ABOUT_SPINDLE) starb136.ogg
SUBJECT: Clear Spindle Device.
DATA: The object in question has no clear use or means of activation
but does have super-conductive characteristics between 18 and 22 degrees C.
We suspect that it is of Precursor manufacture, but we cannot be certain without extended study.
SUMMARY: In all likelihood, this object is a part of a larger device whose capabilities remain unknown.

#(ABOUT_ULTRON_0) starb137.ogg
SUBJECT: Ultron Device.
We put this thing through every test we've got, and came up with the same results as if we'd used a fork
nothing, zero, zip.
If this thing ever functioned -- which we doubt -- it certainly won't now.
Age and physical stress have long since robbed it of whatever `mystical powers' it might have once had.
SUMMARY: In the future, please don't waste our valuable time on junk like this so-called `Ultron.'

#(ABOUT_ULTRON_1) starb138.ogg
SUBJECT: Ultron Device.
DATA: At first we thought this was a piece of junk -- in fact it may still be just that
but when you submitted it to us, we infused it with gamma radiation
and found that the scatter signature was identical to the patterns
recorded from the `Empties', the `Singing Hoops', and `the Big Dud'
which were all found in Precursor burrows on Procyon.
SUMMARY: We are now convinced that this is a Precursor tool, but it remains dysfunctional.

#(ABOUT_ULTRON_2) starb139.ogg
SUBJECT: Ultron Device.
DATA: The Ultron is partially functional, and we can detect energy emission from the device.
We suspect that the unit requires additional minor repairs before achieving full functionality
and at this time, we cannot make an assessment of its capabilities.
SUMMARY: A single additional replacement part should bring the Ultron to life.

#(ABOUT_ULTRON_3) starb140.ogg
SUBJECT: Ultron.
DATA: We have determined that the so-called `Ultron' is in fact the `Appendages of Dawn'
described in the Precursor fragment found on Rigel in 2123.
In the partially translated Precursor text, the device is described as a `Mental Amplifier'
which focuses mental energies of the holder `for the purpose of discreet change'.
Unfortunately, human brain emanations do not seem compatible with the Ultron
nor do those of the allied species we have tested.
SUMMARY: Perhaps the Utwig, who claim to understand this device, can shed some light
on its true function and power.

#(ABOUT_UCASTER) starb141.ogg
SUBJECT: HyperWave Broadcaster - Umgah Design.
DATA: This unit is capable of generating extremely intense HyperWave transmissions
though it is otherwise similar to our own `Casters.
SUMMARY: This thing would be great for practical jokes. You could scream `Boo!' from an Oort Cloud
and scare the pants, or whatever, off everyone in the system.
If you used it in HyperSpace, there's no telling who might hear you and come running.

#(ABOUT_BCASTER) starb142.ogg
SUBJECT: HyperWave Broadcaster - Unknown Design.
DATA: This technology is new to us, but though a bit primitive by Alliance standards
is capable of generating a VERY strong signal.
SUMMARY: Should you wish to call someone in HyperSpace, or send a message through a mile of steel
this baby will do just fine.

#(ABOUT_SHIELD) starb143.ogg
SUBJECT: Taalo Device.
DATA: Whoever the Taalo were, they were clever -- way past us, probably even beyond the Chenjesu.
As far as I can tell, with all our equipment, this thing is a rock.
Just a rock; nothing but a rock. However,
if you feed a current into it, anywhere along its surface
everyone on board this starbase who has esper potential gets a bad headache.
Well we checked a bit more into that, and when the Taalo thing is active
all evidence of psychon interaction is flatlined -- nothing gets through.
SUMMARY: If you keep this Taalo rock device thing on board your vessel
I'll bet you are immune to any form of psychic attack
or at least mostly immune.

#(ABOUT_EGGCASE_0) starb144.ogg
SUBJECT: Mycon Egg Case.
DATA: We really didn't know Mycon came from eggs, but our analysis of this sheath
shows that it has been subjected to phenomenal temperatures and pressures.
The most unusual aspect of the egg case is its size
we know Mycons range in height from .5 to 3.5 meters
but our reconstruction of the whole egg case shows it to be over 25 meters high!
SUMMARY: If a Mycon came out of this, it's gotta be really big.

#(ABOUT_SHUTTLE) starb145.ogg
SUBJECT: Syreen Pilot Shuttle.
DATA: As yet, the field research team has failed to report back to their group leaders.
When we called them, they described being deep in study
and wished to attend to a few important details before returning to the base.
SUMMARY: Several group leaders have volunteered to assist the team to `help them where they can.'

#(ABOUT_VUXBEAST0) starb146.ogg
SUBJECT: Hostile Alien Creature.

#(ABOUT_VUXBEAST1) starb191.ogg
DATA: This is newly-promoted, junior scientist Hawkins reporting.
Dr. Chu -- y'know, he's the leader of this section -- he's still in sick bay.
He's been there ever since that thing took a swipe at him and he got too close to the cage.
I guess it's got like, triple-jointed arms or something... with spikes and razor-plates all over.
Uh... data? Oh yeah, right, right
Subject is a Xenoteratomorph -- a big honkin' one, I might add.
It eats everything -- plants, animal tissue, wood
ceramics, plastics, asbestos fibers
several types of metal
chairs, a desk and about half of everything a security officer wears.
What is doesn't eat, it chews, and what it doesn't chew
well, it breaks up into tiny little pieces.
What... summary? Oh, oh yeah
SUMMARY: The sooner you get that thing off this starbase
the less likely it is that that thing will get loose and kill us all.
Uh... I, uh, I guess that's it.

#(ABOUT_DESTRUCT) starb147.ogg
SUBJECT: Slylandro Probe Destruct Code Sequence.
DATA: This is a complex sequence of program instructions
using an encryption sequence similar in some ways to the Rolling-Phung algorithm.
SUMMARY: When a Slylandro Probe approaches, open a hailing frequency, wait for a response
and then transmit the code.

#(ABOUT_WARPPOD) starb148.ogg
SUBJECT: Ur-Quan Warp Pod.
DATA: This unit appears to be the core for the starboard warp pod of an Ur-Quan Dreadnought.
It is surprisingly similar to our own warp cores
but it generates a much stronger, tighter field than the equipment we have on our Cruisers.
SUMMARY: For us, the Warp Pod is little more than a curiosity
though you may find some useful application for it in the future.

#(ABOUT_ARTIFACT_2) starb149.ogg
SUBJECT: Wimbli's Trident Device.
DATA: I presume this device is named `Wimbli's Trident'
because of the name, `Wimbli', crudely etched into its base.
SUMMARY: To be honest, Captain, I believe that the Druuge robbed you blind.

#(ABOUT_ARTIFACT_3) starb150.ogg
SUBJECT: Glowing Rod Device.
DATA: We had high hopes for this device, Captain, because of the constant, pulsing aura it generated.
However, I am afraid after investigating the object, and locating its concealed batteries slot
we had to conclude that this was nothing more than a well-crafted toy.
SUMMARY: In the future, Captain, I would be very careful of what I bought from the Druuge.

#(LETS_SEE) starb151.ogg
Hmm... let's see...

#(GO_GET_MINERALS) starb152.ogg
I guess I'd gather more minerals to build up a good supply of resource units.

#(IMPROVE_FLAGSHIP_WITH_RU) starb153.ogg
Use the Resource Units you have accumulated to improve your flagship.

#(GOT_OK_FLAGSHIP) starb154.ogg
Your flagship is in pretty good shape

#(GO_ALLY_WITH_ALIENS) starb155.ogg
You should investigate building alliances with non-hostile alien races.
Their assistance is crucial to our success.

#(MADE_SOME_ALLIES) starb156.ogg
You have established several successful alliances with alien races

#(GET_SHIPS_BY_MINING_OR_ALLIANCE) starb157.ogg
Build up your fleet of combat vessels.
Their additional strength and the flexibility granted by their various powers
will greatly enhance your ability to survive in space.

#(GOT_OK_FLEET) starb158.ogg
You've assembled a good-sized fleet of combat ships

#(BUY_COMBAT_SHIPS) starb159.ogg
You need to build combat escorts and assemble a fleet to accompany you through space.

#(GO_LEARN_ABOUT_URQUAN) starb160.ogg
We must find a chink in the Ur-Quan's armor --
-- a weakness that will allow us to focus our strength in such a way
that we can destroy their entire empire in a single, bold stroke.

#(MAKE_FLAGSHIP_AWESOME) starb161.ogg
My guess is you need to upgrade further your flagship
to make it more than a match for any enemy ship you might encounter.
You know the Ur-Quan's Achilles' heel -- their Sa-Matra super-starship

#(KNOW_ABOUT_SAMATRA) starb162.ogg
You know the Ur-Quan's Achilles' heel -- their Sa-Matra super-starship

#(GOT_AWESOME_FLAGSHIP) starb163.ogg
You have constructed a flagship of unrivaled power

#(GOT_BOMB) starb164.ogg
You've got the bomb from the Utwig

#(FIND_WAY_TO_DESTROY_SAMATRA) starb165.ogg
You must find some way to destroy the Ur-Quan supership, the Sa-Matra.

#(MUST_INCREASE_BOMB_STRENGTH) starb166.ogg
Although the bomb you got from the Utwig is horrendously powerful
I'm afraid our computer projections show that the explosion will not be sufficient
to break through the Sa-Matra's defenses.
You must find some way to increase the energy output of the weapon.
Perhaps the Chenjesu and their superior scientific knowledge could have done this
but unfortunately, we do not currently possess the technology to achieve this modification.

#(MUST_ACQUIRE_AWESOME_FLEET) starb167.ogg
I'm certain we need to assemble a more powerful fleet of combat ships before you face the Sa-Matra.

#(MUST_ELIMINATE_URQUAN_GUARDS) starb168.ogg
You must figure out how to eliminate or destroy the Ur-Quan and Kohr-Ah ships guarding the Sa-Matra.

#(CHMMR_IMPROVED_BOMB) starb169.ogg
The Chmmr have modified your ship to route its weapon power through the Utwig bomb

#(GOT_AWESOME_FLEET) starb170.ogg
You have amassed a powerful fleet of combat ships

#(GO_DESTROY_SAMATRA) starb171.ogg
Go attack the Ur-Quan Sa-Matra vessel!
Although I'm sure it will be a difficult battle
you have everything you need to achieve victory.

#(GOOD_LUCK_AGAIN) starb172.ogg
We're all depending on you.  Goodbye, and good luck.

#(IMPROVE_1) starb173.ogg
You need to build up and balance the strength of your flagship.

#(IMPROVE_2) starb174.ogg
My guess is you need to upgrade your flagship
to make it more than a match for any enemy ship you might encounter.

#(NEED_THRUSTERS_1) starb175.ogg
I would add thrusters up to say, 5 or 6.
Speed is essential in combat, but it would also pay off over the long haul in HyperSpace
and if you prefer to avoid confrontation, nothing beats a great pair of legs.

#(NEED_THRUSTERS_2) starb176.ogg
I would maximize your ship's thrusters. You will need speed when you confront the Ur-Quan.

#(NEED_TURN_1) starb177.ogg
I would add turning jets for increased maneuverability

#(NEED_TURN_2) starb178.ogg
I would maximize rotation speed by filling your turning jet slots

#(NEED_GUNS_1) starb179.ogg
I would add enough weapons to defend yourself if you are caught without escort ships

#(NEED_GUNS_2) starb180.ogg
I would take advantage of your ship's capacity for combat by increasing its firepower.
Add more weaponry

#(NEED_CREW_1) starb181.ogg
You need more crew, at least 50, to make productive voyages into space

#(NEED_CREW_2) starb182.ogg
You need even more crew, perhaps as many as 200, to face the challenges ahead

#(NEED_FUEL_1) starb183.ogg
You need additional fuel, at least 50 units

#(NEED_FUEL_2) starb184.ogg
You need large quantities of fuel, at least 150 units

#(NEED_STORAGE_1) starb185.ogg
Increase your cargo capacity by adding more Storage Bays to your flagship

#(NEED_LANDERS_2) starb186.ogg
You need at least one lander

#(NEED_LANDERS_1) starb187.ogg
Build more landers

#(NEED_DYNAMOS_1) starb188.ogg
Your weapons will be underpowered in combat if you don't have at least 1 dynamo

#(NEED_DYNAMOS_2) starb189.ogg
You need more dynamo power;
otherwise your weapon re-energizing delays will be your undoing in combat

#(NEED_POINT) starb190.ogg
I suggest you invest in one or more point-defense laser systems.

#(have_minerals)
Commander, I have minerals to offload.

#(goodbye_commander)
Goodbye, Commander.

#(repeat_bulletins)
Commander, would you repeat what you told me when we began this conversation?

#(need_info)
Before proceeding I need some additional background information.

#(starbase_functions)
