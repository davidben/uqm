#(NEVER_ENOUGH) ilwra000.wav
We Can Never Receive Sufficient Direction From You, Great Masters!
We Eagerly Await Your Next Vile Commandments.

#(OK_WARSHIP) ilwra001.wav
As You Wish, Glorious, Unmerciful Destructors!
In All Future Warship We Will Honor You In This Way!

#(OK_DWE) ilwra002.wav
Yes, Great Dogar! Yes Mighty Kazon! Dwe Certainly Will, Dwe Certainly Will!

#(OK_YOUBOO) ilwra003.wav
It Shall Be So, Great Ones.
Yuubuu Are Mighty!
Yuubuu Are The Most Hideous And Deceitful!
We Ilwrath Are Too Fortunate To Have Yuubuu To Worship!

#(OK_DILRAT) ilwra004.wav
We, The Dill-Rats, Bow And Scrape Off Our Appendages In Your Honor, Mighty Dogar And Kazon!

#(BIG_FUN) ilwra005.wav
Listen!
Once More The Terrible Twosome Are Among Us!
Hear Our Thanks, Mighty Dogar And Kazon!
We Have Found Ultimate Pleasure In Your Cruel Service In These Alien Stars!
Though Our Enemy, The Thraddash, Possess A Tough And Chewy Exterior
Inside These Creatures Can Be Found A Most Smooth And Sweet Set Of Innards.
Their Low Bellows Of Fear And Agony Do Service To Your Names, Great Dogar And Kazon!
We Will Slay These Beasts In Your Name, Until They Are All Dead, Dead, DEAD!

#(FAST_AS_CAN) ilwra006.wav
Our Gods Of Darkness And Pain Call To Us Again!
Evil Dogar, Cruel Kazon! How Can We Be So Fortunate To Hear From You Again?
We Pray Thee Gods, Forgive Us For Not Yet Beginning The Slaying Of The Thraddash.
Quickly Now, I Must Rend Three Limbs From My Thorax As A Sign Of My Supplication.
AIEE!
AIEE!
AIEE!
It Is Done! Dogar And Kazon See My Fluids And Must Smile. I Am Happy!
We Make All Haste, But Are Limited By The Speed Of Our Avenger Starcraft.
We Know Our Pitiful Excuses Are Worthless...
We Must Show Our Shame With The Removal Of Yet More Limbs.
AIEE
AIEE
AIEE

#(GLORIOUS_WORSHIP) ilwra007.wav
Attend! The Cruel Twins Of Pain And Death Have Returned To Instruct Us!
Dogar And Kazon! We Are Your Instruments Of Cruelty And Death!
As We Speak, Our Holy Excruciators Attack The Thraddash, Slaying Unmercifully In Your Names.

#(ON_WAY) ilwra008.wav
Dogar And Kazon Once More Grace Channel 44 With Their Inspiring Words Of Hatred And Cruelty!
Acolyte! Turn The Volume To Maximum Immediately!
Hear Us, Black Dogar! Hear Us, Bloody Kazon!
We Have Heard Your Word And Devote Every Breath To Fulfilling Your Desire For Gratuitous Violence And Death!
As We Speak, A Thousand Starships, Cloaked And Invisible, Make Passage To The Draconis Stars.
Upon Arrival There, The Holy Killing Team Will Begin The Bloody Slaughter You Requested.

#(GODS_RETURN_1) ilwra009.wav
Dogar! Kazon! We Hear Your Summons And Slaughter The Fat Jubby In Greeting.

#(GODS_RETURN_2) ilwra010.wav
From The Black Pits Of Pain The Deific Duo Of Destruction Emerge Once More!

#(GODS_RETURN_3) ilwra011.wav
Our Gods Have Returned Once More, Just As Foretold By This Morning's Rituals!
When We Pulled The Steaming Entrails From The Squirming Sacrifice
and Flung The Fatty Loops Against The Walls Of Our Holy Chambers
the Entrails Stuck Tight, Neither Sliding Nor Peeling Even A Little Bit!
Thus Was Our Gods' Arrival Foretold!

#(JUST_GRUNTS) ilwra012.wav
What Is That? The Voices Of Our Gods Dogar And Kazon? Surely It Cannot Be!
And Yet My Set Is Tuned To The Mystic 44 -- Who Else Can It Be?
I Am Unworthy Of Such Attention As This!
Dogar -- Kazon! Your Divine Words Will Surely Consume Me.
I Beeseech Thee! Speak Directly To The Leaders At Homeworld!
I Am Unworthy.

#(GRUNTS_AGAIN) ilwra013.wav
Hark! We Are Receiving A Holy Transmission.
Oh Dark And Gruesome Masters! I Am Honored With Your Attention.
But Great Gods, I Am But A Simple Ilwrath, A Humble Murderer.
I Am Unworthy To Hear Your Words!
Only At Our Homeworld Orbiting The Green Eye Of Dogar Are There Ilwrath Sufficiently Evil
to Understand Your Commandments. Forgive Me!

#(WHAT_ORDERS) ilwra014.wav
Your Will Is Our Inspiration. What Shall We Do?

#(WE_WORSHIP_1) ilwra015.wav
From The Chambers Of Pain We Hear Your Words, Cruel And Evil Lords Of Darkness.
And As Your Voice Crackles Out Of The Speaker Boxes, It Sends Thrills Across Our Carapaces.
Our Hairy Quills All Stand Erect And We Pant And Wheeze With Holy Fervor!
Oh Mighty Gods! You Are The Definition Of All That Is Evil And Hideous In This Universe!
You Are The Inspiration For All Cruelty, Deception And Pain.
For This We Thank You!

#(WE_WORSHIP_2) ilwra016.wav
We Shall Make Instant Obeisance, Divine Lords Of Darkness!
Acolyte! Light The Candles Of Torment -- Quickly!
No You Idiot! Not The White Ones...
Use The Yellow And Red Ones We Made From The Prisoners Last Week, The Ones With The Lumps.
No Fool, Not Those! They Are Still Wet!

#(WE_WORSHIP_3) ilwra017.wav
Oh Evil Dogar!
Oh Hideous Kazon!
We Shall Toss The Fat Jubbies Into The Pit Of A Thousand Needles!
This We Shall Do In Your Names!
We Shall Bring Forth The Last Remaining Hu-Man Prisoner
And Pull Its Head Apart Slowly, So That Its Cries Last For Hours.
This We Shall Do In Your Names!
We Shall Torment, Terrorize, Maim And Kill, Again, Again And AGAIN!
This We Shall Do In Your Names!

#(SUBSEQUENT_CHMMR_HELLO) ilwra018.wav
So... The Hu-Man Has Returned To Visit Its Entombed Mentors Of Deceit!
I Am Emotionally Moved By This Poignant Moment, And Feel Compelled To Make Immediate Obeisance.
Flaccid Earthling -- I Will Pour Your Warm Circulatory Fluid Across The Altar Of Dogar
And Dance A Jig Of Cruelty Atop Your Cooling Corpse.

#(INIT_CHMMR_HELLO) ilwra019.wav
Caught You, Didn't I?
We Have Monitored Your Visit To This World With Great Interest.
Your Plans For Trickery Are Pitiful
And Make Dogar And Kazon Clack Their Mandibles Against One Another And Snicker With Amusement.
And So Now, Squishy Hu-Man
I Wonder What Sort Of Noise You Will Make
When I Pull Off Your Arms?
A High And Wailing Scream, Or A Low Moan Of Ultimate Suffering?

#(OK_ENOUGH_ILWRATH) ilwra020.wav
And Yet You Know So Little.

#(OK_ENOUGH_GODS) ilwra021.wav
Your Pitiful Investigations Have Barely Scratched The Surface Of What Is To Be Learned
About Dogar And Kazon.
And Remember, You May Never Get Another Chance To Ask Such Questions.

#(SEND_MESSAGE) ilwra022.wav
By The Fetid Breath Of The Dark Twin, Kazon!
A Hu-Man In An Alien Starship... How Fascinating!
When I Intercepted That Ur-Quan Drone, And Learned That An Unidentified Starship Had Approached Earth,
I Never Expected To Find Such A Remarkable Vehicle In The Hands Of A Hu-Man.
Hu-Mans Are Prey Animals - Weak And Helpless-
But Here Is A Hu-Man In An Armed Starship!
And Therefore In Direct Violation Of The Oath Of Fealty.
I Am Sure Our Masters, The Ur-Quan, Will Punish Earth Most Severely For This Treachery....
When I Present Them With The Twisted Wreckage Of Your Ship And Your Many Charred Corpses.

#(CAME_FROM) ilwra023.wav
Since You Will Soon Be Dead, I Will Gladly Explain.
We Have Spent Many Years Gleefully Preying On The Pkunk.
They Are A Pitiful, Easily-killed Species...
And We Would Have Continued In This Divine Worship Of Dogar And Kazon...
But We Required Additional Crew Members And Repairs To Our Cloaking Device.
So We Departed The Giclas Constellation And Set Course For Home.
But Before We Had Reached Our Region Of Space, We Detected The Passage Of A Nearby Vessel - The Ur-Quan Drone.
It Informed Us About You... So Here We Are. 
And Now, YOU DIE!

#(WHO_BLASTS_WHO) ilwra024.wav
I Have No Fear Of You, Feeble Mammal.
Though My Ship Lacks A Functional Cloaking Device, And Many Of Our Crew Are Dead,
My Gods, Dogar The Black And Kazon The Unseen, Have Personally Confided To Me
That They Despise You Hu-Mans, And That They Will Help Us To Kill You All!

#(NO_SURRENDER) ilwra025.wav
Fool!
As Alien As Your Ship May Be, Our Sensors Reveal How Few Weapons You Have On Board.
Though This Vessel Is Under-Crewed, And Our Cloak Of Darkness Is Non-Functional,
We Still Have More Than Enough Power To Kill You All!

#(NOT_REASONABLE) ilwra026.wav
Ha-ha-ha-ha! You Must Be Either A Naive Child Or A Hopeless Fool.
In Either Case, It Makes No Difference, Because Soon You Will Be DEAD!

#(SUBSEQUENT_HOME_HELLO) ilwra027.wav
I See That You Have Come To Your Senses
And Are Now Prepared To Engage In The Festival Of A Thousand Screams.
Although Your Initial Rejection Of The Honor Was Dismaying,
We Realize That It May Have Been A Shock To Be So Privileged.
Ha Ha, Pinch Yourself, Hu-Man! You Are Not Dreaming.
Dogar Has Winked And Kazon Has Spasmed In Condescending Approval.
Today, Hu-Man, Is Your Lucky Day!

#(GENERAL_INFO) ilwra028.wav
Though Such Information Is Normally Holy And Secret,
I Find I Am Unable To Contain Myself. Know This Fact, Hu-Man
You Are Hu-Man, Weak And Alone In This Universe With No Gods To Protect You.
I Know This, Because The Only True Gods Are Our Own Ilwrath Deities, Dogar And Kazon!
Dogar Is The Killer In A Black Cloak...
The Great Destroyer...
The Bloody-Clawed Murderer...
The Dark Beast With A Thousand Young!
Kazon, On The Other Claw, Is The Great Deceiver...
The Malevolent Evil In The Darkness...
The Unstoppable Monster Who Has No Pity...
The Hungry Lurker In The Night.
These Are Our Gods -- The ONLY Gods!
How Do We Know, You Ask? Because Dogar And Kazon TOLD US So.

#(GOODBYE_AND_DIE) ilwra029.wav
Not So Fast, Tender Hu-Man! You Must First Pay Homage To The Universal Deities Dogar And Kazon!
The Payment Is Simple And Within Your Means.
You Will Pay With Your Lives!

#(DECEIVERS) ilwra030.wav
DECEIVERS!
We Know That You Are Not Truly Dogar And Kazon!
Your Foolish And Childlike Attempts To Fool Us Shall Be Your Death!

#(NO_PEACE) ilwra031.wav
Excellent! We Enjoy The Process Of Rending Life So Much More When The Life Giver Is Willing.
Come Now In Peace And Give That Which Makes You Live!

#(NO_ALLIANCE) ilwra032.wav
Silly Earthling! The Ur-Quan, Our Masters, Would Be Displeased If They Were Aware Of Your Transgressions!
By Violating Your Oath Of Fealty To The Ur-Quan, We Are Obligated To Take Your Lives As Payment...
A Process That Will Incidentally Please Both Myself And, More Importantly, The Arch-Deific Duo!

#(ILWRATH_BELIEVE) ilwra033.wav
Listen!
It Is The Hideous And Inspiring Voices Of Our Gods, Dogar And Kazon!
Oh Great Gods Of Evil And Darkness, What Can Your Humble And Devious Servants Do For You?

#(OK_KILL_THRADDASH) ilwra034.wav
Oh Mighty Dogar!
Oh Mighty Kazon!
Your Devoted Servants Hear Your Words And Obey Your Divine And Cruel Insights.
The Pkunk Are Unfit For OUR Sacramental Tortures!
We Relish The Prospect Of Killing Worthy Prey!
We Will Leave Immediately So That We Can Begin Our Glorious, Evil Devotions...
But Who Shall We Prey Upon Next?
Who Will Suffer Our Inspired Torment?
Hmm
Didn't Those Loathsome Umgah Once Mention A Race Near Their Region Of Space?
Hmm
YES! I Have It! The THRADDASH!
We Will Go NOW, And Kill All Of Them!

#(GOODBYE_GODS) ilwra035.wav
Farewell Dogar And Kazon. We Are Awed By Your Malevolent Presence, And Swear Unto You
To Commit Even More Vile And Treacherous Deeds Tommorrow Than We Did Today!

#(INIT_HELLO_SPACE) ilwra036.wav
What? Can I Believe My Sensory Cluster? I Sense Hu-Mans!
I Dance With Joy For Our Good Fortune.
The Hu-Man Dies With Such Agony That It Cannot Help But Please
Dogar And Kazon.

#(SUBSEQUENT_HELLO_SPACE_1) ilwra037.wav
What Is It? Mmmm, Hu-Man! It Has Been Long Since I Have Seen A Hu-Man Die! 
We Will Bet On How Many Parts We Can Remove Before It Stops Making Noise!
Now, You Space-Ship Captain, Begin The Expedient Transfer Of All Hu-Man Crew
So That We May Waste No Time.

#(SUBSEQUENT_HELLO_SPACE_2) ilwra038.wav
Ah, Hu-Man! You Join Us In The Celebration Of Dogar And Kazon!
We Grow Excited: The Hu-Man Makes Excellent Ceremony.
When We Peel It, Urgent Bleating Comes From The Noisemaker.
Then The Green Eye Of Dogar Observes It Writhe Upon The Altar
And The Cilia Of Kazon Swell, Indicating Their Readiness For The Juices.
It Squirms With Vigor Until We Pop The Crunchy Noisemaker.
Rejoice! The Duo Of Deception Shall Receive Their Supplication.

#(SUBSEQUENT_HELLO_SPACE_3) ilwra039.wav
Your Fortuitous Arrival Bodes Well For Our Ceremony Of Consumption!
The Hu-Man Must Prepare: It Must Perform A Complete Depilation,
And Then Anoint Its Surface With The Larval Paste Of Our Stillborn Offspring.
At The Altar Of The Duo Of Darkness We Suck The Bony Strength From The Fleshy Weakness
While The Hu-Man Squeals For Either Dogar Or Kazon!
Hu-Man, Listen Closely To These Words
Favor Neither God With Your Screams, Lest You Tragically Taint The Consumption!

#(SUBSEQUENT_HELLO_SPACE_4) ilwra040.wav
By The Green Eye Of Dogar, It Is A Squishy Bone-Bag Hu-Man!
It Is Waiting For Kazon To Knead Its Body With The Cilia Of Dread
Until It Can Only Roll And Bleat.
Hah! It Can Only Hope To Be So Honored.
Even Now It Begs For Death And So Now I Must Decide...
Will It Be By Sequentially Bursting Sensory Apparatus Until Nothing Remains?
Will It Be By Shaking It Until It Is Oozing All Over?
Will It Be By Chewing Off Bits And Pieces Until It No Longer Functions?
Hmm, I Think Not The Latter -- Too Many Bones.

#(GENERAL_INFO_SPACE_1) ilwra041.wav
Hah! Puny Hu-Man! You Make Me Chitter With Amusement!
By The Will Of The Mighty Dogar And Kazon I Am Here To Make You Die, Die, DIE!

#(GENERAL_INFO_SPACE_2) ilwra042.wav
It Is The Good Will Of Dogar And Kazon That Brings The Fodder Hu-Man To Us!
Were It Not For The Dark Lords Of Deceptions' Mighty Directive,
We Would Not Have The Good Fortune To Intercept You For A Festive Limb Wringing!
Your Fight For Life, Though Futile, Serves The Noble Purpose
And Appeases Our Honored Deities.
You Have Earned The Right To Hold Your Head High!

#(GENERAL_INFO_SPACE_3) ilwra043.wav
Incorrectness! We Come From The Eye Of Dogar.
Such A Quasar Exists Nowhere Near This Location!
Look In The Heavens At Location 022.9, 366.6
And Gaze Into The Depths Of Its All-Seeing Eye If You Dare!
Only By The Sparing Caress Of Kazon's Anointed Cilia Will You Survive Such An Act.
Else, You Will Bless The Altar Of Consumption With Your Ceremonial Blood!

#(GENERAL_INFO_SPACE_4) ilwra044.wav
In The Brief Golden Moment - During The War With Your Alliance -
We Ilwrath Enjoyed Unequaled Merriment And Festivities.
So Much Blood And Lymph Fluid -- Ecstasy!
Then, After The Ur-Quan Made Your Kind Fallow Slaves,
We Were Forced To Use Species Indigenous To Our Planet For Amusement.
We Lived A Pleasant Existence Until A Scandal Rocked The Ilwrath!
The Grah -- Our Favorite Species To Torment, Which We Carefully Maintained At The Brink Of Extinction,
Had Been Completely Consumed!
A Bureaucratic Error Was To Blame.
Quality Death Became Rare. Our Highly Advanced Civilization Began To Show Signs Of
Degeneracy.
In Our Moment Of Need, We Prayed To The Mighty Duo For Direction,  And They Answered.
`Go Forth', They Said. `Seek The Bird Beings.
Pluck Them Slowly. Eviscerate Their Gasping Husks. Let Dogar And Kazon Drink Their Death And Pain!'
We Went Forth And We Found The Pkunk, But Hu-Man, Now We Are Supremely Joyful...
Because You Die So Much Better!

#(GENERAL_INFO_SPACE_5) ilwra045.wav
Blasphemer! You Are Not Fit For The Most Holy Rituals Of Devivication And Consumption!
Dogar And Kazon Would Most Assuredly Gag On Your Sour Flesh
And Spit Your Thin Soul Onto The Ninth Mountain Of Hell.
Therefore We Shall Simply Cut You Up And Feed You To The Pets.

#(STRENGTH_NOT_ALL) ilwra046.wav
Ha Foolish Flesh Sac, Your Obsession With Strength Spells Your Doom. 
Only Through Enlightenment Achieved With Diligent Ritual Worship Of The Twins Of Darkness
Can A Being Truly Be Victorious!
Death, No Matter What The Source, Feeds The Wicked Pair.
It Is An Ultimate Honor And Victory To Die For This Purpose.
We Know In The End Only The Truly Devout Will Reap The Reward That Dogar And Kazon Dispense!

#(NO_SLAY_BY_THOUSANDS) ilwra047.wav
You Amuse Us With Your Nonsensical Ramblings.
We Look Forward To The Careful Exploration Of Your Structure.
First, We Will Peel Back The Curious Follicle-Infested Outer Layer
Followed By The Greasy Blankets Of Yellow Lard.
Such A Confusing Hodge-Podge Of Parts Can Entertain For Hours!
Hu-Man, Prepare Yourself For The Festivities!

#(NO_EASE_UP) ilwra048.wav
Relax -- Yes! Dogar And Kazon Could Not Say It Better!
We Will Engage In The Best Stress-Relieving Activity.
Prepare Your Tepid Flesh Bag For Death!

#(GOODBYE_AND_DIE_SPACE) ilwra049.wav
Where To, Hu-Man?
We Are Here To Escort You To The Glistening Chambers Of Pain
Home Of The Heinous Twins Of Darkness.
We Will Assist You On Your Journey Of Expiration.

#(INIT_HOME_HELLO) ilwra050.wav
What A Pleasant Surprise! Ever Since The Ur-Quan Made It A Fallow Slave Species
We Have Missed The Hu-Man! You Arrive Just In Time For The Festival Of A Thousand Screams.
We Welcome You With Open Appendages!
Your Participation In The Ceremony Is Most Fortuitous.
As We Pour Your Steaming Parts From Your Breached Husk
You Will Cry With The Force That Pleases The Mighty Deities Dogar And Kazon!
Then We Will Address Our Inquiries And Receive Deific Guidance. Glorious!

#(GOODBYE_AND_DIE_HOMEWORLD) ilwra051.wav
You Leave? The Festivities Have Not Yet Begun -- You Have Uttered Nary A Single Scream!
Our Pain-Pots Have Been Freshly Mixed, And We Have Sharpened Our Poppers.
Wait! We Cannot Permit You To Miss The Happy Times Of Terror And Torment.

#(SO_MUCH_TO_KNOW) ilwra052.wav
There Is So Much To Tell -- So Many Different Aspects!
These Deities Permeate The Fabric Of The Universe.
Since All Things Eventually Succumb To Death, All Things Meet Dogar And Kazon.

#(LONG_AGO) ilwra053.wav
Hu-Man, You Do Not Understand. It Is As It Has Always Been.
When The Hatchlings Struggle From The Egg Sac
They Show Their Respect To The Twin Gods Of Death During Their First Frenzied Gorging.
From That Moment On, The Directives And Philosophies Of Dogar And Kazon
Are Manifested By The Hatchling.

#(KILLED_GOOD_GODS) ilwra054.wav
During The Dark Ages, Yes, We Were Confused By The Many Gods.
There Were Dozens Of Deities Ranging From Zith Of The Pelt
To Awk Of The Seds.
It Was Only Through The Careful Formation Of A Priestly Ruling Body
That The Ilwrath Were Able To Determine The True Gods Dogar And Kazon!
This New Priestly Cabal Revealed That We Must Discard All Other Gods
Be They Of Hearth Or Flowing Web.
Only The Priests Were Capable Of Interpreting The Will Of The Gods.
Their Order Refined Our Worship Until We Could Do No Better.
Specifically, All Heretics Were To Be Eaten,
And All Possessions Were To Be Delivered To The Holy Sites
Or The Priestly Dwellings.

#(CHANNEL_44) ilwra055.wav
The Deific Duo Broadcast On Channel 44. Their Words Of Wisdom Are
Available To All And The Instructions Are Carried Out To The Best Of Our
Mortal Ability. We Know That We Are Pleasing The Gods Because They
No Longer Find It Necessary To Guide Us. In The Past, The Dark Twins
Were Compelled To Direct Us Almost Daily, But Now Have Received No
Direction For Almost Eight Years. Indeed, We Diligently Monitor The
Channel Should Dogar And Kazon Choose To Be Heard.

#(BECAUSE_44) ilwra056.wav
They Do It For Us.
First, They Clear The Channel Of Messy Static And
Interference. Second, It Made It Easy For Us To Properly Identify What
Might Be Mistaken For Mad Rambling As The Sacred Words. You See,
Dogar Possesses 44 Eyes That See Into The 44 Planes Of Existence And
Each Of Kazon's 44 Sub-Tongues Is Made Up Of 44 Plump, Writhing
Cilia. Besides, They Knew We Were 'Captain Satellite' Viewers.

#(WHAT_ABOUT_ILWRATH) ilwra057.wav
Yes, Your Interest Is Not Unusual. It Is Through The Omniscient Guidance
Of Our Mighty Lords Of Darkness That We Have Achieved This State Of
Near Perfection. We Will Dispel Your Ignorance Concerning The First
Child Species Of The Unmerciful Dogar And Kazon.

#(ABOUT_PHYSIO) ilwra058.wav
Yes, Our Striking Appearance Only Hints At The True Strength That
Resides Inside. Coursing Through Our Thorax Are The Fluids Of Life. 
Like Yourselves, If We Leak In Excess, We Will Satiate The Sacrificial
Needs Of Dogar And Kazon. Our Mandibles Allow Us To Communicate,
Take Sustenance, And Deliver Pain. The Appendages You See Here
Allow Us To Manipulate Our Technologies And Will Regenerate When
Damaged Or Lost As Often Happens In Many Of The Rituals Of Pain. Our
Sensory Cluster Lets Us Monitor The Whim And Will Of The Deadly Duo
In The Complex Sequence Of Events That Leads Us All To Death.

#(ABOUT_HISTORY) ilwra059.wav
For Eons We Lived Appendage To Mandible.
Then, Many Millennia Ago, We Received The Guidance Of Dogar And Kazon.
This Enabled Us To Move Beyond The Simple Existence Of Tranquil Hunter-Gatherers,
To Become World-Striding Avatars Of Death And Destruction.
Over The Many Years, We Advanced Our Technology -- Always In The Name Of Dogar And Kazon
Always In The Development Of More Sophisticated Tools For Murder.
Then, The Gods Gave Us The Means To Go Forth And Commit Even More Glorious Acts!
This Was 29 Years Ago, When The Ur-Quan Improved Our Starships And Weapons.
The War Against Your Alliance Was Glorious!
But Alas, All Good Things Come To An End. You Lost.
We Honored The Wishes Of The Soft And Merciful Ur-Quan And Stopped Eating You Hu-Mans.
To Continue Our Festive Ceremonies Of Death We Began Employing Our Native Species For Ceremony.
Things Seemed To Be Going Well Until We Accidentally Exhausted Our Supply Of All These Life Forms.
We Became Distraught And Called To Our Gods For Guidance!
Then, Eight Years Ago, Dogar And Kazon Responded To Our Wails Of
Dismay By Directing Us To Devour Feathered Bird Beings-The Pkunk!
We Now Penetrate Deeply Into Their Home Space!
When We Complete Our Mission Of Genocide
We Are Certain That We Will Once Again Hear From Dogar And Kazon.

#(ABOUT_CULTURE) ilwra060.wav
Ah, Our Culture Is Rich With Meaningful Tradition.
During The Birth Rite The Egg Sac Teems With Many New Potential Deaths
The Hatchlings Fight Over Their First Frothy Draught Of Blood.
In The Ensuing Frenzy, Many Hatchlings Are Consumed, Either Partially Or In Their Entirety.
A Frequently Performed Ceremony Of Affirmation Has The Participant Grinding Away Partial Or Even Whole Appendages.
It Is The Pain That Acknowledges The Greatness Of The Twins Of Excruciation
How Can They Help But Notice The Scream Caused By The Mangled Nervous Tissue?

#(ABOUT_URQUAN) ilwra061.wav
The Ur-Quan Are But The Instruments Of Dogar And Kazon, Even Though They May Not Admit To It.
This Is Because It Was The Evil Twins That Had Them Assist Us With Their Technologies And Resources.
Their Soft Merciful Nature Sickens Both Gods But They See The Potential That The Ur-Quan Possess.
If You Doubt This Statement, Notice That The Ur-Quan Dreadnought Is Staffed With 42 Crew Members.
Since Dogar And Kazon Exhibit The Quality Of Omnipresence
The Total Crew Complement Is Actually At The Auspicious Count Of 44!
That The Ur-Quan Are But Instruments Of The Dark Twins Of Death Is A Foregone Conclusion.

#(URQUAN_TOO_NICE) ilwra062.wav
Simply Put, The Ur-Quan Are Far Too Kind To Please Dogar And Kazon.
When Your Species Was Subdued, Our Gods Made Clear Their Desire For Immediate Deaths By The Billion.
We Made Plans For A Grand Ceremony To Be Called `Mountains Of Flesh'.
We Built Thousands Of Portable Altars, And Transported Millions Of Blood Gowns And Fillet Knives To Your World.
But Then The Ur-Quan Commanded That You Hu-Mans Were To Be Left Alive! The Confusion!
With Our Plans For A Magnificent And Most Holy Planetary Slaughter Forcibly Terminated
We Retreated To Our Homeworld To Sulk.

#(OF_COURSE_WERE_EVIL) ilwra063.wav
Ha! Evil! Of Course We're Evil!
Dogar And Kazon Would Never Reward A Less-Than-Hideously Evil Species With Their Baleful Grace.
Why We Are The Very Definition Of Evil!
Everything About Us, Within And Without, Reeks Of Heinous Deeds, Deceit And Treachery!
Even Our House Pets Are Rather Evil.

#(DONT_CONFUSE_US) ilwra064.wav
Hmmm... We ARE All Evil.
We All Behave In A Mutually Agreed-Upon Fashion Of Murder, Torture, Deceit And So Forth.
Our Uniform Acceptance Of This Heinous Credo Creates An Orderly And Cooperative Society
Which Hardly Seems Evil.
Evil Is Doing Things That Make Others Hurt Or Fear.
We ALL Do That, Of Course.
But Since We ALL Do Such Things, As Sanctioned By Our Culture,
It Would Be `Bad' To Do Otherwise.
Which Means...
Er... 
Puny Hu-Man, Do Not Play With Words! You Anger Both Dogar And Kazon! Now You Must Die!

#(ON_WAY_TO_THRADDASH) ilwra065.wav
Begone Hu-Mans!
We Would Very Much Like To Tear Off All Your Digits...
And Be Entertained Fitting Them Into Your Orifices...
But We Are On An Evil Jihad And Cannot Be Bothered Killing You At This Time.
Perhaps Later.

#(HAPPY_FIGHTING_THRADDASH) ilwra066.wav
From Channel 44 Came The Words Of The Dark Twins To Make Bloody Pilgramage!
We Have Arrived In the Holy Killing Zone and Eagerly Execute the Commands of Dogar and Kazon.
The Slaying Has Been Excellent -- High Ceremony!
Now You Are Here, Befouling The Event With Primate Chatter.
Begone Hu-Man! You Interfere With The Blessed Murder Worship Of The Dark Twins.
