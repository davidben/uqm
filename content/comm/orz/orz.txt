#(HERE_BECAUSE)	orz002.wav

#(ALLIED_HOMEWORLD_HELLO_1)	orz003.wav
Hello to our *house*. Do you feel *better* yet?
If you are *campers* you will enjoy *the change*, but maybe not yet.
It is best if many happy Orz are coming to your *house*.
Let's *spitting* the fun words for several *pieces* and then surprising things!!!

#(ALLIED_HOMEWORLD_HELLO_2)	orz004.wav
This is my *house*. Do you want to know a *secret*? Do not *think* it to *not campers*.
You are so many *lonely* *juicy* *bubbles*. It is so sad.
Now that you are *campers* you will have more *parties*
and no more *sad* *lonely* *bubbles*.
This is the *secret*.

#(ALLIED_HOMEWORLD_HELLO_3)	orz005.wav
Happy to come to my *house* some more times. I am Orz.
I do not have the name because I am Orz. Orz is the name.
Do you want to *squirt*?
If you want to, then you do. It is best, I know it.

#(ALLIED_HOMEWORLD_HELLO_4)	orz006.wav
Happy to come to my *house* some more times. I am Orz.
I do not have the name because I am Orz. Orz is the name.
Do you want to *squirt*?
If you want to, then you do. It is best, I know it.

#(ALLIED_SPACE_HELLO_1)	orz007.wav
Oh, the *alliance* *party* *campers* are in the *now space*.
It is *happy spices*. Why are you there?
Of course because also the Orz are in the *now space*.
So I am waiting for you to *spit*. It is a pleasure.

#(ALLIED_SPACE_HELLO_2)	orz008.wav
*Campers* like to say `hello' when they *smell* the Orz.
We have learned this. It is *no function* but Orz want to make *campers* happy everyday.
Okay... Hello!! Now you are happy I am sure.

#(ALLIED_SPACE_HELLO_3)	orz009.wav
I am *expanding!* It is so much *squishy* to *smell* you!
*Campers* are the best! I have *anticipation* and then what?
Better parties in *the middle* for sure.

#(ALLIED_SPACE_HELLO_4)	orz010.wav
I am *expanding!* It is so much *squishy* to *smell* you!
*Campers* are the best! I have *anticipation* and then what?
Better parties in *the middle* for sure.

#(whats_up_ally)
Uh.....Hi there. Its good to see you again....I think.

#(GENERAL_INFO_ALLY_1)	orz011.wav
That is *funny*. You think you *see* Orz but Orz are not *light reflections*.
Maybe you think Orz are *many bubbles* too. It is such a joke.
Orz are not *many bubbles* like *campers*. Orz are just Orz.
I am Orz. I am one with many *fingers*.
My *fingers* reach through into *heavy space* and you *see* *Orz bubbles*
but it is really *fingers*.
Maybe you do not even *smell*? That is sad.
*Smelling* *pretty colors* is the best *game*.

#(GENERAL_INFO_ALLY_2)	orz012.wav
Perhaps you have not been to the *Playground*.
The *Playground* is for Taalo and for Orz, but *Campers* can go.
It more fun than several.
The *Playground* is 372.1, 261.9 your *silly* numbers.
You can go there for too much fun.

#(GENERAL_INFO_ALLY_3)	orz013.wav
Hello! I will say again for extra enjoyment. So much a fun game.
Hello! Hello! Next I will *spit* *slow time* words to you for better *dancing*.
Do you know? Orz can *dance* very well.
Now you are a *happy camper* and Orz can give *heavy space* ships for *dancing*.
Orz will give. Orz ships have the GO! GO!. Do you know?
These are best for letting go near *heavy space* planet bodies.
Then GO! GO! can going fastest to enter ships of the *other*.
Then it is *happy time*.

#(GENERAL_INFO_ALLY_4)	orz014.wav
Even more *pleasant combinations*. I am *successful* the most.
Perhaps after the biggest *party* you will understanding the Orz
and I can showing you other *levels*.
There are so many, but you only *play* on this one.
One is not enough.
We are *friends* now. Never be afraid to *open* enough and *spread the wax*.

#(more_about_you)
I'm afraid I'm still not exactly clear on who you are and where you're from.

#(ABOUT_US_1)	orz015.wav
You are a *silly* *camper*. I am always Orz.
If I was not Orz, then I would not be, but of course I am Orz.
We are from *outside*. Also the Arilou *quick babies* are from *outside*.
It is the same, but not.
Orz are from *below*, Arilou are from *above*.
Orz does not like Arilou. Arilou are too much trouble.
We can not have *parties* when Arilou always *jumping in front*.
It makes Orz *frumple* so much.
These are *fat* words. Do you want to play this some more?

#(ABOUT_US_2)	orz016.wav
I will tell again the many *pieces*. You do not know *special things*.
Here is some. *Time* is not one but many.
*Space* is many. *Colors* are many. You are so *sticky*.
You cannot *slide* like Orz from *outside* to *inside* and *in between*.
It is sad, but Orz can *pull* the *campers* after being *connected*.
This is soon.
Orz are trying to *pull* the Androsynth, but they are so *silly*, they do not want.
Arilou can *slide*. Also Taalo. Many can *slide*, but Orz are better of course.

#(ABOUT_US_3)	orz017.wav
Here is *good news*!
Six or nine *pieces* ago, myself the Orz did not even *smell* your *level*.
Can you believe? It is so silly! It is such a *happy town*.
Then the Androsynth made some *slippery places* and then Orz can *smell* it.
It *smells* so good Orz are surprised!
I, myself pushed the *fingers* into the *new town* and there are so many *campers*.
First the VUX, but they are such *silly cows*
they ask so much about the Androsynth we must *dance* with them.
Then we can *smell* the Arilou. Again they are *jumping in front*.
It is always! Nnnnggaaahhhhh!
There is *juice squeezing* and then we are not so *frumple*.
Finally we find you, the *happy campers* and the Taalo *playground* for sliding through.
Where are the Taalo? There they are. It is too much fun.
We are too happy, in this *slow time* *heavy space*. It is a better *level* for games.
This is the everything story. Now you know.

#(ABOUT_US_4)	orz018.wav
I am already telling the everything story. It is too much.
You do not asking about us the many.
Next it is the *party* and you will *become*.
It is best.
After this you are so *happy* you do not ask the many questions.
Do you anticipate? Yes! You do!
I am too *tired* the *silly* word *game*.

#(where_androsyn)
Our charts show this as Androsynth space. Do you know what happened to them?

#(DISEMBLE_ABOUT_ANDROSYN)	orz019.wav
Androsynth are not here. Orz are here.
You are not the same too much like Androsynth. You are *happy campers*.
Do you want to see our surprising *toys*? No!! Do Not!!
Androsynth are so silly. We do not *tell stories* a lot about them.
No more Androsynth stories.

#(must_know_about_androsyn)
What happened?? Dammit, what did you do to the Androsynth?!!

#(KNOW_TOO_MUCH)	orz020.wav
Nnnnnngaaaa!!!! I am *squeezing* the *juice*.
You have become too close. You are *sick* for the last time!
Nnnnnnggggaaaaaa!! It is not enough for *happy days* I am sure.
More and more *juice!*
Androsynth are not the story!!

#(dont_really_care)
Uh, that's okay. I didn't really care about them so much anyway.

#(YOU_ARE_OUR_FRIENDS)	orz021.wav
Ahaa! I am told other Orz *cousins* you are *connected* for *camping*.
I am so right!
It is happiest days to not care about Androsynth anything.
So now we can be *together* for friendly *dessert*.
I am so right. I will tell them again.

#(about_andro_1)
Now please don't take this the wrong way, but what did happen to the Androsynth?

#(FORGET_ANDRO_1)	orz022.wav
I am say best word *frumple*. Maybe you do not know.
*Frumple* be *round* and yet *lumpy*. So bad!!!
The asking about Androsynth is so *frumple* we are not happy.
Do not asking it so much.
It is better to not *frumple* or else there is so much problems.
No more Androsynth is better.

#(about_andro_2)
Just tell me this. Are we in for the same fate as them?

#(FORGET_ANDRO_2)	orz023.wav
You are not same. You are *happy campers*, but already you know.
I will not talking about *silly Androsynth*, now is stop asking.
If you are say the question another time
it is *frumple* too much and Orz are *dancing* for *dissolving* the *campers*.
I am clear!!
You are not so *silly*!

#(about_andro_3)
Okay, okay. Now this isn't really a question, but let's say you WERE going to talk about the Androsynth. If you were, what would you say?

#(BLEW_IT)	orz024.wav
Nnnnnggggaaaahhhhh!!!!!! It is *dancing*!!!!

#(NEUTRAL_HOMEWORLD_HELLO_1)	orz025.wav
This is my *house.* Did you come to *play*?.
Do not be sad if you are *other*. We can still have a *party*.
There are never enough *campers*.

#(NEUTRAL_HOMEWORLD_HELLO_2)	orz026.wav
You want to *take* *silly* words in *slow time*. It is okay.
I will *spit* words and then perhaps it is the *party*.
Welcome to my *house* or *other house*.
It is a joke! Only it is my *house*.

#(NEUTRAL_HOMEWORLD_HELLO_3)	orz027.wav
Again you have come to my *house*. It is the same time.
Why are you coming? Do you always the *slow time*?
I am surprised!
Oh well. Now is for *fun time*, not worrying.

#(NEUTRAL_HOMEWORLD_HELLO_4)	orz028.wav
Again you have come to my *house*. It is the same time.
Why are you coming? Do you always the *slow time*? I am surprised!
Oh well. Now is for *fun time*, not worrying.

#(NEUTRAL_SPACE_HELLO_1)	orz029.wav
Hello extremely! I hope you like to *Play*.
Some *campers* are not so good for *games*.
Is it time for *playing* yet?

#(NEUTRAL_SPACE_HELLO_2)	orz030.wav
Pleasant *combinations*! We have been *anticipating* about you.
Do you like *parties*? We do several times, and so much the better.

#(NEUTRAL_SPACE_HELLO_3)	orz031.wav
So much *juicy*! Let's have *party time* sooner.

#(NEUTRAL_SPACE_HELLO_4)	orz032.wav
Hi. You seem like good *campers*.
Perhaps we can do *snappy fun* with you everytime.

#(hostile_1)
Do not attempt any hostilities or you will be immediately destroyed.

#(HOSTILITY_IS_BAD_1)	orz033.wav
If you are *sick* you should have a *party*.
We can come and *play* at your *house*.

#(hostile_2)
We have no time for childish nonsense. We require information. Comply at once.

#(HOSTILITY_IS_BAD_2)	orz034.wav
*Extra sick fish* need *special training* for extra *fun*.
We will have a *happy party* now.

#(we_are_vindicator0)
Greetings. I am Captain 

#(we_are_vindicator1)
, of the starship 

#(we_are_vindicator2)
. We are having some difficulty translating your messages.

#(NICE_TO_MEET_YOU)	orz035.wav
Yes, of course. Difficulty. Problems are difficult.
Let's be *special* together. *Spicy games* are always fun.

#(seem_like_nice_guys)
You seem like friendly fellows. Perhaps you could aid us in our mission?

#(ARE_NICE_WANT_ALLY)	orz036.wav
Yes. Yes. We are too friendly.
Extremely happy *sisters* should correct each other for *celebration*.
So much enjoyment!
Shall we come to your *house* so that we can be *relatives*?

#(talk_about_alliance)
We have reconsidered the idea of an alliance between our peoples.

#(OK_TALK_ALLIANCE)	orz037.wav
So much the better! Orz have been waiting for *alliance* time.
I will show you the inside.
It is so good that you will never leave.
Oh, I am so excited for expecting *alliance parties*.
Yes! Yes! Reconsider is best.

#(yes_alliance)
Uh....I presume you are talking about an alliance. Yes, we are very interested.

#(GREAT)	orz038.wav
Jumping *peppers*!! This is smiley time!
You are *campers* after all!!
We will start *alliance* *parties* for better enjoyment!

#(no_alliance)
I am not quite sure, but I think the answer is no.

#(MAYBE_LATER)	orz039.wav
Disappointing *conclusions*.
Maybe we can play *alliance* another happy day.
I will tell *Orz puppies* to wait for *camping*.

#(decide_later)
No point in rushing into anything. Let us think about it some more.

#(OK_LATER)	orz040.wav
Yes! Think and then do! You will tell us soon. Soon is now.
*Parties* can be so much fun for other reasons.
*Alliance* is good.

#(why_so_trusting)
You seem very... uh, trusting. Why is that?

#(TRUSTING_BECAUSE)	orz041.wav
We are not trusting. We like to be *together*.
Do you want to be *together* with us?
Always the other *sad animals* go away, but first we have lots of fun.
Too many fun is not enough!! Do you agree?
I think you *smell* like you do.
This is the story about trusting.
It is sad and makes many Orz *dissolve* or burst into several.
Why is it that you are trusting? What a funny question.
I am tired.

#(bye_neutral)
Well, it's been.... uh... well, I'm afraid I have to go now. Do you understand?

#(GOODBYE_NEUTRAL)	orz042.wav
Going. Yes. Orz is go with you same place for *party*.
Nobody is forget.
Next is *alliance* *party*. Always promise is good to keep.
So much pleasure is coming, Orz and the you is change together as soon as *camping* is started.
You are not even aware, and then everyone is so happy.
You are not forget. Alliance is promise.
Orz are wait.

#(ANGRY_SPACE_HELLO_1)	orz043.wav
Orz are find you! You do not *play* with Orz so it is not even *happy town*.
Orz are think that *dissolving* is a better chance for you.
This is a good plan. Orz are accomplishing this for better *games*.
Now is time for *dissolving*.

#(ANGRY_SPACE_HELLO_2)	orz044.wav
So many times Orz are say 'Hello, we are Orz', but next is always same.
Certainly you are *silly cows*.
Now is try again for *dissolving*. Of course this is best for extra fun.
After dissolved, *silly cows* will not be *frumple*
and Orz will have *special sauce*, not the *juice*.

#(ANGRY_HOMEWORLD_HELLO_1)	orz045.wav
You have come to our *house* but we cannot *play* the fun *games* with you.
Nnnnngggaaahhh!!
You are not even *campers*. Why are you coming to our *house*?
We cannot *smell* you even a little.
So much trouble in *slow time* is not the best.

#(ANGRY_HOMEWORLD_HELLO_2)	orz046.wav
You are not *connected*! Too many times I speak the *silly* words in *slow time*.
No more speaking.
Next you must *dissolve* and *become* the second time.
Orz will help you *dissolving*.

#(whats_up_angry)
You appear to be upset. Have I offended you somehow?

#(GENERAL_INFO_ANGRY_1)	orz047.wav
Orz is upset! Not one the many!
We are *squeezing* the *juice*!
You are showing that you are not *happy campers*
and so Orz cannot have the *party*.
Orz need *party* or there is no fun and we are *frumple* everyday.
This is so sad, Orz is upset of course.

#(GENERAL_INFO_ANGRY_2)	orz048.wav
Too many times explaining the silly words.
How many time? One? Two? Three? Seven?
Orz are ready to find new *friends*. You do not want to *play*.
Do not coming to our *house*.

#(were_sorry)
I'm not sure what I said wrong, but in any event, I'm sorry.

#(APOLOGY_ACCEPTED)	orz049.wav
*Sorry* is good fun. Yes, we are see it is the *game*.
You are strangest *campers*, but Orz is understand now.
We will come to your *house* and we will be *sorry* too.
Then is *partytime*.
Oh, the funny *joke* is *sorry*. There are no more *silly cows*.
This is *happy town* after all!

#(insult_1)
You are a dangerous species. We want nothing to do with you.

#(insult_2)
If anyone is going to do any `dissolving' around here it's going to be you!

#(insult_3)
That's it! I've had it! You're dead.

#(insult_4)
That's it! I've had it! You're dead.

#(insult_5)
That's it! I've had it! You're dead.

#(insult_6)
That's it! I've had it! You're dead.

#(insult_7)
That's it! I've had it! You're dead.

#(insult_8)
That's it! I've had it! You're dead.

#(INSULTED_1)	orz050.wav
*Dangerous* is not the way! Orz are happy *fun* days all the time.
*Silly cow* is so strange Orz think.
Next *silly cow* are *dissolving* and no more word making in *slow time*.
Then *happy days* are here again.

#(INSULTED_2)	orz051.wav
Orz are not *dissolve*! Why is the *silly cow* say Orz are *dissolving*?
Too much crazy perhaps. You are so sick even for a *party*.
Again I am *squeezing* the *juice*. Nnnggaaaahhh!!
It does not even helping.

#(INSULTED_3)	orz052.wav
We are not *dead*. Orz is never *dead*.
Orz is thinking *silly cow* are want to *dance*.
Orz can *dance* very well *in between*
but not as much fun as *parties*.

#(INSULTED_4)	orz053.wav
We are not *dead*. Orz is never *dead*.
Orz is thinking *silly cow* are want to *dance*.
Orz can *dance* very well *in between*
but not as much fun as *parties*.

#(bye_angry)
You are just too darn strange. I'm out of here.

#(GOODBYE_ANGRY)	orz054.wav
Orz cannot be *strange*. Orz is Orz. Strange is other thing.
You are the *silliest cow* even more so.
At least you can *dance* with Orz.
After the *dancing* Orz think you will make good *special sauce*.
Maybe even for other Orz *party*, so do not be sad.

#(ANGRY_TAALO_HELLO_1)	orz055.wav
Who is it? It is the *not Campers*.
Maybe you have come to Taalo *playground* for a *Picnic*.
No!!! It is not the case! *Silly Cows* can never have a *picnic*.
Of course. Not even a party.
If you are gone, Orz can have fun some more.

#(ANGRY_TAALO_HELLO_2)	orz056.wav
I am not expecting, and then what? Again the *Silly Cows*.
You think that the *Playground* is a *fun* place?
I will explain. It is not.
Now it is explained. Of course you understand.
It is enough talking the words. You are leaving.

#(FRIENDLY_ALLIED_TAALO_HELLO_1)	orz057.wav
Happy *pieces*! I am *squirting nice colors*!
Why? The reason.
*Camper friends* have come to Taalo *Playground*.
Why are you coming to this?

#(FRIENDLY_ALLIED_TAALO_HELLO_2)	orz058.wav
I *smell* you so much. *Campers* are pleasant.
You are coming again to the *Playground*.
We can have extra fun for future *parties* in *quick time*.

#(demand_to_land)
I demand that you allow us to pass so that we can land on the surface.

#(NO_DEMAND)	orz059.wav
NNNNgggggaaahhhhh!!!!!! You are *frumple*! You are silly!!
Is this happy? NO!!! I cannot *spit* words with *Cows*!
There is no demanding!
We will *dance* now for several *pieces*.

#(ASK_NICELY)	orz060.wav
You are not *spitting* happy words. Demand is not happy.
If you want to going onto *Playground* then *happy words* are best.
Do you understand the most?
It is so simple.

#(why_you_here)
Why are you here at this planet?

#(ANGRY_EXPLANATION)	orz061.wav
This answer is not for *Silly Cows*.
You do not know Taalo. Taalo are not the *friends*.
You are coming to the *Playground* and then making words.
Always you make Orz *squeezing juice*. We do not have enough.
I do not want to *smell* you now.

#(FRIENDLY_EXPLANATION)	orz062.wav
I will tell. This is Taalo *Playground*. Do you know?
Taalo is not anymore the *heavy space*. Many *camper* lives they are not here.
To *play* with Taalo, Orz must *spread* into *Pretty Space*.
There are so many good places for this here, Orz are happy.
Of course you do not know Taalo. You are *Campers*.
You cannot going to *Pretty Space*, too bad.

#(what_is_this_place)
What do you mean by `Playground'? Can you explain some more?

#(FRIENDLY_PLACE)	orz063.wav
Yes. Yes. You say words, then I say.
It is fun *in between*. More fun than *dancing*.
Many *gravity centers* in *heavy space* make good *party places*.
This is why we like the *New Town*. So many *Campers* and then what?
Even the *Playgrounds*! Such a surprise!
At this *Playground*, Taalo are making *Time jokes*. It is too funny for the Orz.
Taalo are in *heavy space* and next what?
They spread to *Pretty Space* because Dnyarri are chasing them.
Now Dnyarri are sleeping, so Orz can *chase* them.
Then we can have a *party*. They are even better *campers* than you.
Do not feeling bad. You are good enough *campers*, but not yet.

#(ANGRY_PLACE)	orz064.wav
Why explaining? You are not a *camper*! You are too *hard*!
If you want *words with fluid* then you must be *campers*!
Of course you are so silly. That is too much. Do not asking about *playgrounds*.
If you want to be a *camper* you can go to my *house*.
Silly name is Gamma Vulpeculae.

#(may_we_land)
Would you mind if we did a bit of exploring on the planet's surface?

#(SURE_LAND)	orz065.wav
You are ask if Orz are upset? Orz are not upset.
You are *happy campers*. Certainly you are only *slow time* *walkers*.
It is not fun on the surface in *slow time*.
If you want to go, that is okay.

#(ALLIES_CAN_VISIT)	orz066.wav
Only *campers* can go to the *playground*.
*Alliance parties* are often a good idea for better *parties*.
Even for *picnics*.
Do you want to be *campers* for the *friendly days*?

#(make_alliance)
All right, all right. We'll be `campers'. How do we do that?

#(CANT_ALLY_HERE)	orz067.wav
*Jumping Peppers!* I am *squirting* more *nice colors*.
It is the best way!
You will be very happy *campers*. Do not be *terrified*.
It is better as *campers*.
You must going to my *house* to start *camping*.
It is 371.3, 253.7 location.
We are so busy here for starting the *campers*!

#(why_busy)
What are you busy doing?

#(BUSY_BECAUSE)	orz068.wav
Busy is because Orz have reason. It is secret for *campers*.
You must going quickly to my *house*.
It is too bad you cannot **HYUIVBHJHG** there
but flying the *heavy* ship is okay.
Perhaps next we will show you our toys. But do not look!!!
Now you will go to my *house*.

#(bye_taalo)
Well, it's been swell, but I really should be going now.

#(bye_ally)
I could stay and talk all day, but I'm afraid I must go. Farewell, allies!

#(GOODBYE_ALLY)	orz069.wav
Yes! We do! Goodbye is the *Game*. Hello!! I am only joke.
It is funny enough. Do not forget to *enjoy the sauce*!!!

#(FRIENDLY_TAALO_GOODBYE)	orz070.wav
I am so sad myself. You are not here and then I do not think of *parties*.
Oh well. It is so much excitement for the next time.
You must leave now so then you must come back.
Yes. I understand very well.

#(ANGRY_TAALO_GOODBYE)	orz071.wav
Finally you are *absorbing*. I am tired of *spitting* the meaning.
Go. It is *happy days* after you are gone.
Then I will have enough *juice*.
So much the better.

#(HOSTILE_HELLO_1)	orz072.wav
Nnnnnngaaaa!!!! I am *squeezing* the *juice*.
More and more *juice!*
You are *sick* for the last time!

#(HOSTILE_HELLO_2)	orz073.wav
Nnnnnggggaaaahhhhh!!!!!! It is *dancing*!!!!
