#(GLAD_WHEN_YOU_COME_BACK) coman000.ogg
Hurry back, Captain.

#(GIVE_FUEL) coman001.ogg
We do have a small amount of Starship fuel which is of no use to our power systems.
We will now transport 5 units to your vessel.
This should be sufficient for one trip to the surface of Mercury.

#(GIVE_FUEL_AGAIN) coman002.ogg
We are almost out of fuel now, but we do have a BIT more.
You will have to be more careful with this supply.
Transporting fuel now.

#(ARE_YOU_SUPPLY_SHIP) coman003.ogg
Attention unidentified space vessel!
I am Starbase Commander Hayes of the slave planet Earth.
our hyperwave broadcasts -- extremely weak
situation critical -- energy cores exhausted
scanners and deep radar are non-functional
we cannot identify your vessel
Are you the scheduled Hierarchy resupply ship?
Repeat, are you the resupply vessel?

#(DO_YOU_HAVE_RADIO_THIS_TIME) coman004.ogg
Did you find any radioactive elements for our power cores?

#(HERE_IS_ANOTHER_LANDER) coman005.ogg
What!!!
You lost another lander!?
We shall build another, but DON'T LOSE THIS ONE, OKAY!

#(THE_WHAT_FROM_WHERE) coman006.ogg
The starship what?
Never mind -- look, we won't last much longer. Here is our situation
According to our Oath of Fealty to the Ur-Quan, we must maintain this starbase
but, we have no space vessels of our own
and the shield prevents us from contacting Earth
so we are totally dependent on the Ur-Quan supply vessels for everything we need up here.
We know there is a Hierarchy base on the surface of the moon, but we can't contact them.
The Ur-Quan were supposed to resupply this base at regular, five year intervals
but we haven't received anything in almost eight years!
What we don't recycle we can usually synthesize
but to do so, we need replacement radioactives for our generators' energy cores.
If you could bring us some radioactive elements, we can fabricate the cores ourselves.
Are you willing to help us!?

#(ABOUT_TIME) coman007.ogg
Well, it's about damn time!
In the Fealty agreement the Ur-Quan promised that this station would be resupplied
at least every five years, and its been over eight since we last saw you!
If you had arrived a few weeks later, there wouldn't have been anyone alive on this station
never mind...just begin your transfer of materials immediately, starting with the radioactives.

#(MESSAGE_GARBLED_1) coman008.ogg
I'm sorry, Captain, your message was garbled. Our receivers have very little power.

#(MESSAGE_GARBLED_2) coman009.ogg
I couldn't quite make that out, Captain. Could you please repeat?

#(HERE_IS_A_NEW_LANDER) coman010.ogg
Manufacturing a new lander for you will use most of what little resources we have left
but I suppose we have no choice.
We will transport the new lander to your vehicle immediately.

#(THIS_MAY_SEEM_SILLY) coman011.ogg
By the way Captain, I think we need a name for this new alliance we're going to forge.
Since this was your idea, it's only fair that you have the honor of naming it.
So, what will it be?

#(OK_THE_NAFS) coman012.ogg
Okay, that sounds pretty inspiring. So be it - The New Alliance of Free Stars!

#(OK_THE_CAN) coman013.ogg
Very well.  From this day forward, we are The Concordance of Alien Nations!

#(OK_THE_UFW) coman014.ogg
That has a familiar ring to it... nonetheless, we will make it so - The United Federation of Worlds!

#(OK_THE_NAME_IS_EMPIRE0) coman015.ogg
Ulp!  Well... you're the one with the big starship.
So be it - The Empire of 

#(OK_THE_NAME_IS_EMPIRE1)
!

#(FUEL_UP0) coman016.ogg
We are initiating transfer of radioactives, Captain.
Now, as soon as our engineers can refit the energy cores

#(FUEL_UP1) coman017.ogg
there, that's much better. Power ratings are climbing, life support is coming back into the green.
Deep radar systems and sensors are now online and I can scan your vessel.
!!!? -- WHAT THE HELL KIND OF SHIP IS THAT!?
Just who ARE you, Captain?

#(WHAT_KIND_OF_IDIOT) coman018.ogg
WHAT!
What kind of idiot sent you out here without replacements for our energy cores!?
It's amazing that we've kept the generators online for as long as we have!
Look, you had better get those radioactives right away
or all the other supplies are pretty damn pointless, since we'll be too dead to use them!

#(DONT_KNOW_WHO_YOU_ARE) coman019.ogg
Look, I don't know who you are or why you're here
but right now the only thing I'm worried about
is saving the lives of the 1900 men and women aboard this starbase
and right now you're our only hope.
I can't keep the transmitter on too much longer -- we need the power for heat and air
so if you don't have any radioactives on board your vessel
please get some and bring them back here before it's too late.

#(THATS_IMPOSSIBLE) coman020.ogg
Star Control science mission, eh?
Captain, I served as a Star Control officer during the war, aboard several cruisers on the Coreward Front
and if there had been any 'scientific mission' to Vela
I would have heard about it.

#(ASK_AWAY) coman021.ogg
Okay, what do you want to know?

#(RADIOS_ON_MERCURY) coman022.ogg
The fastest way to get radioactives in this system would be to land on Mercury
and scour the surface for deposits of radioactive elements.
But be careful. Mercury is a pretty inhospitable place!
Watch out for earthquakes and hotspots.

#(THANKS_FOR_HELPING) coman023.ogg
Thanks! I'll make sure to mention this the next time I talk with our masters
I'm sure they will reward you.

#(STARBASE_IS) coman024.ogg
Ur-Quan slave law requires that we maintain an orbital space platform
to assist Hierarchy vessels which are in need of repairs or fuel.
Since the shield around Earth cuts us off completely from the planet
we are dependent on Ur-Quan resupply ships for our non-renewable resources.
The resupply vessels are supposed to arrive every five years
at which time the Ur-Quan somehow penetrate the shield and exchange those of us up here
with replacement personnel from the surface.

#(HAPPENED_TO_EARTH) coman025.ogg
When the Alliance lost the war, the Ur-Quan gave Earth a single choice
join the Hierarchy as Battle Thralls and fight for the Ur-Quan to enslave other sentient species
or become `fallow' slaves, and be forever imprisoned on a single world
encased in an impenetrable energy shield here on Earth.
We chose not to fight for the Ur-Quan.

#(URQUAN_LEFT) coman026.ogg
Soon after Earth accepted the Ur-Quan's Oath of Fealty, they departed,
leaving behind a battle group of Spathi and Ilwrath ships based on the moon.

#(BASE_ON_MOON) coman027.ogg
Ahh...fight the Ur-Quan! Win back our freedom!
I remember having such thoughts myself...once, a long time ago.
But that was in the first years after the defeat, when it was still terrifying to look up
and see the bloody glow of the pulsating slave shield overhead.
Through day and night we gazed up at that impenetrable wall
as though the sheer power of our hatred would pull it down.
But over the years, I spent so much of my time struggling --
-- down on the surface under the shield and then later up here, trying to keep this station alive --
-- that I'd forgotten what it means to be free... to hate our Ur-Quan Masters! 
And now, here you are, in an alien ship of unknown power,
offering me your assistance to fight against the Hierarchy again, after all these years.
Captain
your offer is intriguing.
It's tempting to think that with your advanced Precursor technology
we can somehow crack Earth's slave shield
and reassemble the Alliance to attack the Hierarchy, and THIS time win the damn war!
But... consider the consequences if we should fail.
The Ur-Quan won't just punish us here at this station.
They will exact a gruesome retribution on the surface below as well.
Before I commit this station to helping you attack the Ur-Quan
and accepting the risk of annihilation if we are defeated
I have to be sure that you and your ship have what it takes to oppose the Hierarchy.
I'll make you a deal.
If you can eliminate the alien base on the moon, and get rid of that threat, at least
I will seriously consider your offer.

#(ACKNOWLEDGE_SECRET) coman028.ogg
Hmmm... you know, come to think of it
there were some rumors that Corridor Nine, the special operations division of Star Control
was directing some hush-hush operation out near Androsynth space.
The Vela star system... yes, that would be in the right direction
So, Captain... if what you say is true
how do you explain that huge, alien starship you're flying
and why are you here? What do you want from us?

#(ABOUT_BASE) coman029.ogg
After the Ur-Quan erected the slave shield around Earth, and established this space station
they decided to leave a contingent of combat ships close to Earth
to keep watch on our planet and confirm that we were obeying the Ur-Quan slave laws.
I'm certain they're still out there on the surface of the moon
because we can pick up a constant stream of alien broadcasts.

#(GOOD_LUCK_WITH_BASE) coman030.ogg
Be careful, Captain.
There are probably a dozen Spathi Eluders and Ilwrath Avengers down there on the lunar surface.
I don't know why they haven't come after you yet
but when they do, you'd better have your weapons armed, and your thrusters burning hot.

#(DEALT_WITH_BASE_YET) coman031.ogg
Have you dealt with the base yet?

#(HERE_COMES_ILWRATH) coman032.ogg
Captain, listen closely!
Long range sensors show a ship closing on this station, fast!
Our computer identifies it as Ilwrath, Avenger-class.
I think you've got a fight on your hands, Captain.
Your best bet is to wait until it's at point bl-nk r-nge
C-pt-in! It's ja-min- ou- s-gn-l!...

#(VERY_IMPRESSIVE) coman033.ogg
What a beautiful sight, Captain!
I haven't seen an Avenger blown away like that since the Battle in Draco.
I guess you've shown that you can handle yourself in a battle, Captain
so my last reservation about helping you has been dissolved.
I will commit this station to helping you free Earth and defeat the Ur-Quan.
We may get our atoms rearranged in the process, but by God, Captain, we're going to try!
So
the obvious first step is to get your Precursor equipment and software over here
where we can make it work with our ship repair fabricators.
But then what, Captain?

#(IT_WAS_ABANDONED) coman034.ogg
I'll be darned!
All these years we've been listening to their incoherent broadcasts, and we never even guessed.

#(YOU_REALLY_FOUGHT_BASE) coman035.ogg
You fought them, Captain!?  I hope you didn't suffer serious casualties?

#(IM_GLAD_YOU_WON) coman036.ogg
I'm delighted to hear it, Captain.  I wish I could have been there.

#(IM_SURE_IT_WAS_DIFFICULT) coman037.ogg
I'm sure the experience was disturbing

#(THAT_WAS_PROBE) coman038.ogg
That was the Ur-Quan Security Drone. It keeps an eye on us.
Captain, what happened to the spy drone!?

#(DEEP_TROUBLE) coman039.ogg
Oh no. Right now it's probably cruising through HyperSpace
heading right towards the closest Hierarchy outpost.
When the Ur-Quan find out that you are here, they will send a combat fleet instantly!

#(GOOD_NEWS) coman040.ogg
Whew!  That was a close one.  If that probe had gotten away -- up into HyperSpace
we'd be up to our ears in Dreadnoughts in no time.
What a relief!

#(SURE_HOPE) coman041.ogg
If that probe gets back to the Ur-Quan, Captain, we are BOTH in deep trouble!

#(ABOUT_BASE_AGAIN) coman042.ogg
As I said before, after the Ur-Quan erected the slave shield around Earth and assembled this space station
they decided to leave a contingent of Spathi and Ilwrath ships stationed on the moon.
We have looked at the moonbase through our telescopes and can confirm that there is still substantial activity down there
but we have never been able to make contact with the base using either the HyperWave `Caster
or traditional radio signals.

#(COOK_BUTTS) coman043.ogg
Ha-ha.. yes, Captain, we'll do just that!

#(OVERTHROW_ALIENS) coman044.ogg
If you feel this is necessary Captain, I understand.

#(KILL_MONSTERS) coman045.ogg
A sensible plan, Captain.  Let's get to work.

#(GOOD_LUCK_AGAIN) coman046.ogg
Good luck.

#(STARBASE_WILL_BE_READY) coman047.ogg
Now Captain, I expect the configuration process for this starbase
to take at least 2 weeks, so let's get to work...

#(overthrow_evil_aliens) 
Er... trust me Commander, I have a plan... a really good plan!  But for now it must remain a secret.

#(annihilate_those_monsters)
We will slowly build our strength, unify an allied starfleet, and bring the Ur-Quan to their knee-equivalents.

#(cook_their_butts)
Then, Commander, we will proceed to kick some major alien butt!

#(where_get_radios)
Where can we acquire radioactives?

#(well_go_get_them_now)
We will leave now and bring back the elements you require.

#(we_will_transfer_now)
We are ready to transfer radioactives.

#(what_will_you_give_us)
What will you give us in exchange for radioactives?

#(before_radios_we_need_info)
Before we help you, we require certain information.

#(no_but_well_help0)
No, this is the starship 

#(no_but_well_help1)
, but we stand ready to assist you.

#(yes_this_is_supply_ship)
Uh.. yes, this IS the resupply vessel. What do you need resupplied?

#(what_slave_planet)
`Slave planet!' `Hierarchy resupply vessel!'  What is going on here?

#(i_lied)
Actually I lied, this isn't the resupply vessel. Sorry.

#(plumb_out)
Er..., oh dang!  Wouldn't you know it; we're plumb out of those.

#(we_are_vindicator0)
I am Captain 

#(we_are_vindicator1)
 of the starship 

#(we_are_vindicator2)
. We are the survivors of a Star Control science research team to the Vela star system.

#(first_give_info)
I need you to explain a few things.

#(we_must_go_now)
We must leave now. I shall tell you more when we return.

#(where_can_i_get_radios)
Where can we find the radioactive elements you need?

#(ok_i_will_get_radios)
We will leave now to find the elements you require.

#(whats_this_starbase)
To begin with, what is the purpose of this starbase?

#(what_about_earth)
What is that strange red glow around Earth?

#(where_are_urquan)
Where are the Ur-Quan now?

#(our_mission_was_secret)
The mission was highly secret.

#(we_are_here_to_help)
We have returned to Earth to give you the technological secrets of the Precursors, and to help you fight the Hierarchy.

#(tell_me_about_base)
What details can you give us about the base on the moon?

#(we_will_take_care_of_base)
We shall go now and neutralize the base.

#(tell_me_again)
Could you tell me again about the Hierarchy base on the moon?

#(base_was_abandoned)
We found the base, but it was abandoned years ago.

#(we_fought_them)
We, uh... attacked the moonbase, and completely destroyed the enemy!

#(oh_yes_big_fight)
Er... oh, yes! It was a very vicious fight.

#(i_lied_it_was_abandoned)
Actually I lied. We found it abandoned.

#(i_cant_talk_about_it)
It was too horrible for words. I just can't talk about it right now.

#(i_lost_my_lander)
Due to circumstances beyond our control, our only landing vehicle was destroyed.  Can you replace it?

#(i_lost_another_lander)
Um... er... well... We lost another lander.

#(need_fuel)
We are unable to land on Mercury and retrieve radioactives due to an unforeseen fuel shortage.

#(need_fuel_again)
Boy, mileage sure does vary. Could you spare us some more fuel?

#(what_was_red_thing)
Commander, what was that red, fast-moving object in orbit around Earth?

#(it_went_away)
When we approached, it transmitted a warning and warped into Hyperspace.

#(we_destroyed_it)
Er... we destroyed it! Yessiree, blew it to bits.

#(what_probe)
Uh, I meant a different red thing. Never mind.

#(take_care_of_base_again)
Now we're ready to take care of the moon base, Commander. Goodbye.
