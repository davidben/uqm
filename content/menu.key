# Keyboard control definitions for the menus.  Most keys can be
# described in a straightforward manner; consult the name table in
# src/sc2code/libs/input/sdl/keynames.c for the names of unusual keys.
# Most keys can be named by just the symbol they produce.

# Menu controls.  Both sets of arrow keys, basically.  Paging controls
# moving quickly through the file lists in Super Melee.  Zooming
# controls zoom controls in the starmap.  "Cancel" is also used to get
# you into menu mode to begin with.  There is a "Special" command
# currently unused by the game.  It seems to have been originally used
# to call up details on starships in the Super Melee selection screen.
